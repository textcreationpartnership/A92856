            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOds good Providence doth hand unto thee in this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, The <hi>whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Prodigal Son,</hi> both interpreted and improved, Doctrinally and Practically, for the Spiritual Advantage, from the Pen of a Workman, who needed not to be aſhamed. Herein, the Sinners <hi>Averſion</hi> from God, <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to God, and his <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God, are profitably unfolded &amp; applied. Helps in theſe ſeveral Subjects, are well worth every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans welcome; and time ſeriouſly ſpent in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch Diſcourſes, will not be labor in vain. <hi>Adam,</hi> by forſaking God, loſt his primitive Glory, which cannot poſſibly be repaired in his Poſterity, but by returning to his Majeſty-Man cometh into the World with his Back towards Heaven, and with ſtrong Antipathies againſt God; yea, his conſtant courſe of life is a departing from the Lord, till his Highneſs by Omnipotent Grace doth change both his Heart and Way. And when the ſecure Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is well awakened to conſider his wofull Apoſtacy, attended with the ſad Conſequents thereof, together with the impoſſibility of
<pb facs="tcp:115664:3"/> all Creature ſoccours to relieve him, then, and not till then, doth he ſeriouſly think of facing about towards God, whom he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with inexcuſable neglect and diſhonor.</p>
            <p>Now the ſelf condemning Convict, in this dolefull condition, upon frequent ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflexions, &amp; aggravating his woful Apoſtacy, doth find it very difficult to hold up hope of gaining re-admiſſion into the favor of ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; forſaken Deity. This poor <hi>Spira</hi> did expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as his tears, his torments, together with his deſponding, deſpairing language doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. But in this pitifull plight, the ſinking ſoul may receive ſtrong ſupports, by conſidering, with application, what loving Entertainment the guilty, worthleſs Prodigal received from his offended, forſaken Father. Theſe particulars, which we do only hint at are here largely handled for thy profit; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof, is deſired and prayed for, by</p>

               <p>THis Chapter conſiſts of three Parables, all of them tending to one ſcope and iſſue, though diſtinct in their ſpecial matter and object. The firſt Parable is of <hi>a Sheep,</hi> from <hi>verſ. 4.</hi> to <hi>verſ. 8.</hi> The ſecond of <hi>a piece of Silver,</hi> from <hi>verſ. 8.</hi> to <hi>verſ. 11.</hi> The third of <hi>a Child,</hi> from <hi>verſ. 11.</hi> to the end.</p>
               <p>All of theſe agree in two conditions; One, of <hi>Loſs,</hi> the Sheep was loſt, the Groat was loſt, and the Child was loſt: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115664:6"/> of <hi>Recovery;</hi> the Sheep that wandred, is brought home; the Groat which was loſt, is found out; and the Son who depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is returned and accepted. There be who undertake the <note place="margin">Cyril</note> Reaſons of theſe Parables or dark ſimilitudes, under which Chriſt doth couch ſome ſpecial Leſſon; as, why man is compared to a <hi>Sheep, viz.</hi> becauſe of our Creation, wherein <hi>God made us, and not we our ſelves; we are the ſheep of his paſture.</hi> Pſal. 100. And why man is then compared to a <hi>Groat;</hi> becauſe of that ſingular image of God which was ſtamped in man at his creation; as the royal image of a King is ſtamped upon ſuch a piece of Coin. And then, why man is compared to a <hi>Son;</hi> becauſe of that near relation which he had to God, being once able to call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And then, why in every one of theſe, to a <hi>loſt</hi> Sheep, a <hi>loſt</hi> Groat, a <hi>loſt</hi> Son, becauſe of his revolt and departure from God by ſin: Nay, and if it were lawfull to put and uſe free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits on Parables, (as I am ſure ſome of the Ancients do, as St. <hi>Auſtin, Gregory,</hi> &amp;c.) what if in this threefold Parable, you might eſpie a threefold cauſe of mans fall. "In the ſheep wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, <hi>Satans ſuggeſtion;</hi> "In the Groat loſt by the woman, <hi>the womans yielding;</hi> "In the Sons departing, <hi>Adams voluntary revolting,</hi> and ſpending of his happy eſtate and condition. But theſe and ſuch like obſervations, though to ſome they ſeem more acute and pleaſant, yet to me they are frothy and unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Touching the Parable therefore, concerning which I am to <note place="margin">The Scope of the Parable, with a diviſion of the chief Heads thereof. Who are meant by the two Sons.</note> treat, there are ſeveral conjectures about the ſenſe and intention of it. Concerning the <hi>Father</hi> of the two Sons, they all agree; but about the <hi>two Sons,</hi> they differ. Some by the two Sons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> The <hi>Angels,</hi> they were the elder Son; <hi>Man</hi> the younger, being created after them. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels abode at home with their Father, Man had the ſtock put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, and in a quick time loſt himſelf and it. This opinion you ſee hath ſome kind of Vicinity or correſpondency; <hi>ſenſus pius</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks of it) but not <hi>proprius.</hi> And there is one pregnant Reaſon againſt it in the Text; for that the elder Son in this place, is deſcribed to be grieved and ſad at the acclamations and welcome teſtimonies of the younger Brothers return; but the Angels <hi>rejoice</hi> and are glad at <hi>the converſion</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <hi>of a ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115664:6"/>
               <p>2. Others by the two Sons underſtand the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were the elder, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the younger; the <hi>Jews</hi> kept home, as it were; of all the Nations of the Earth, they ſeemed to be the incloſure for God and his ſervice; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were as it were excluded, rejected, wandring ſheep, a loſt people; yet at length God through Chriſt looks after theſe loſt ſheep, <hi>(the other ſheep of his fold,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.) and returns and accepts of the Gentiles, which did much <hi>provoke the Jew,</hi> (as the elder Son was here provoked at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and acceptance of the younger, and kept out.) they were <hi>provoked to jealouſie</hi> by thoſe who once were not a people. This interpretation pleaſeth S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> and ſome others; and indeed it bears a fair congruity with the Parable in moſt reſpects.</p>
               <p>3. But the third and general opinion is, that <hi>by the elder Son</hi> is meant the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> (and under them any Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries) perſons too conceited and confident of their own works, ſervice, righteouſneſs, as this elder Son who had been (as he ſaid) <hi>thus long in his Fathers houſe and never tranſgraſſed any of his Commandments,</hi> but ſerved him carefully; which indeed was the opinion of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who <hi>truſted to</hi> and <hi>boaſted of their own righteouſneſs:</hi> And that by the <hi>younger Son</hi> is meant the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> perſons more notoriouſly riotous and infamous in ſinning, utterly forſaking of God, as it were, and living without him. And the end of this Parable was to convince the proud and envious <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> (who in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and 2. of this Chapter, <hi>murmured againſt Chriſt</hi> for <hi>receiving Publicans and Sinners:)</hi> Now Chriſt tells them, that though theſe notorious ſinners were deſpiſed by them, yet he <hi>came to call them to repentance,</hi> and that God would be moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgent and gracious to them; though they had been great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſors, yet now being penitent, he would receive them into ſingular mercy and favour, and that with much joy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little reaſon had they to ſnarl at his reſpect and deſires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Publicans and great ſinners. Thus for the ſcope of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which is, <hi>To declare the ſingular readineſs of God in and through Chriſt, even to receive the moſt notorious ſinners, proving penitent.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:115664:7"/>
               <p>Now the Parable conſiſts, or rather comprehends two eſtates <note place="margin">The parts of the Parable.</note> of the Prodigal Son.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> where are conſiderable, 1. The <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> of it, <hi>v. 12. Father, give me the portion of goods that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to me.</hi> He would have the eſtate in his own hands: He loſt himſelf, by de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iring to be Lord of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sin it ſelf,</hi> called <hi>riotous living,</hi> v. 13. lightly come, and lightly gone, which quickly waſted all the ſubſtance. Now whether this ſubſtance were thoſe good Qualities in Creation, or good Gifts of mind or eſtate afterward, it is ſomewhat diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; upon which I ſhall conſider in its time and place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The event of it:</hi> That eſtate being ſpent, he bethinks of an other courſe; indeed, now he ſhould have thought of coming back to his Father, but he did not; nay, he tries all concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before he reſolves on that: Therefore again obſerve, upon the Loſs and conſumption of his Eſtate,</p>
               <p>Firſt, his <hi>earthly policy, He joyns himſelf with a Citizen of that Countrey,</hi> v. 15. By whom ſome underſtand the Devil; ſo S. <hi>Ambroſe, Civis iſte eſt iſtius mundi Princeps.</hi> Others, ſome kind of earthly or worldly employment: But being joyned with him, his ſervice is ſordid, for he is ſent <hi>into the fields</hi> (no houſe ſhall hold him who forſakes Gods houſe) <hi>to feed the ſwine;</hi> he is made a ſervant of the naſtieſt beaſt, who would not continue the ſervant of the beſt Father and God. Secondly, his <hi>extreme miſery;</hi> this ſhift did no way help him: Nothing ſupplies, when God forſakes; and no way is comfortable, when we prove ſinfull. <hi>He would fain have filled his belly with the husks which the ſwine did eat, and no man gave him to eat.</hi> v. 15. Ah, what a change doth ſin make! Here is one, whiles he continued with his Father, enjoyed excellent ſociety, tender love, compleat plenty; but now forſaking his Father, he keeps company with the ſwine, is extremely pinched with hunger, glad would he have been ſerved after the very hogs, and no man regarded him in this miſery and want; ſo that now there is a loſs of all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and a certainty of famiſhing and periſhing, if he returns not, and hereupon comes forth.</p>
               <p n="2">The ſecond eſtate of him, which was of <hi>his Converſion and Penitency:</hi> Where you have three things obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115664:7"/>1. His <hi>Conſultation,</hi> ſet forth by a double act of reflection. 1. <hi>Poſitively.</hi> Firſt, <hi>f himſelf,</hi> ver 17. <hi>He came to himſelf</hi> Secondly <hi>of others,</hi> his fathers ſervants, and their condition. 2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> wherein he compares his preſent condition with theirs, in the utility or conveniency of it; <hi>They have bread, but I have none:</hi> Quantity of it, They have <hi>bread enough, but I hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Reedundancy of it, They have enough, and to ſpare, but I periſh with hunger: yea the meaneſt in my fathers houſe, the ſervants, the <hi>hired ſervants,</hi> yea all in my fathers houſe, though many, they have bread enough; what, and ſhall I a ſon famiſh and periſh? Surely if my father hath bread enough for ſervants, he will have ſome for a child; and if he hath to ſpare for hired ſervants, he will have ſome to ſpare for a famiſhing child.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>Reſolution;</hi> and indeed upon the ſenſe of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing miſery, and his fathers bounty and clemency, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved now what courſe to take. And me thinks he turns off an objection which might ſpring in his mind; yea my father hath plenty at home, and for hired ſervants, but then they are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and careful, but I have been a waſtful prodigal, a riotous ſpender, a departing and unkind child: To which hee gives an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiver; 'Tis true, yet for all that I am reſolved to change this courſe, and I will home to my father. Nothing, no not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinnings muſt hinder our penitentil turning to God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now in this Resolution of his, there are four things which he did firmly purpoſe and intend:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Averſion,</hi> to relinquiſh and quit that baſe and miſerable life and courſe, [ver. 18. <hi>I will ariſe] q. d.</hi> I will reſt here, dwell here no longer; live thus, no, not a day more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Converſion,</hi> to return to his father <hi>[and go to my father].</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> to acknowledge 1 His ſin. 2. His unworthineſs. If my father, thinks he, tell me that I have gone away from him; and have offended him, why and I will prevent him, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs as much; I will not defend, nor excuſe, nor mitigate, nor mince the matter; I will ſay, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and before thee,</hi> ver. 18. And if my father tell me, I deſerve never to be looked on, and there is no reaſon on my part why hee ſhould look on me as a ſon, or ſpeak to me as a ſon; why, and I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115664:8"/> will confeſs that too, that my courſes have been ſo ſinful and vile, that I am not worthy to be called his ſon; not onely to be a ſon, but to be called a ſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Supplication;</hi> to intreat his Father, that yet he would look upon him, and own him, and accept of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> q. d. <q>If I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſons place, yet I will beg hard of a ſervants place; and if I cannot get a choicer ſervants place, yet I will put in for an hired ſervants place; and if I cannot get any ſervants place, yet I will get to be as one of the ſervants, as one of the hired ſervants;</q> which ſhewed the humility of his heart, and alſo the vehemency. When the heart is truly broken and humbled, any near relation to God, any owning from God will be acceptable to the ſoul; if God will look on the lowlineſs, on the unworthineſs of the ſinner, how pleaſing is it to him</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly follows the life of all, namely the <hi>practical exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of all this. This counſel enlarged it ſelf to a reſolution, and this reſolution is crowned with an actual performance: for <hi>verſe 20. He aroſe, and came to his father.</hi> Where again obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some things or paſſages on his Fathers part, <hi>viz. 1. His quick obſervation;</hi> his <hi>Father ſaw him,</hi> ver. 20. nay, <hi>he ſaw him when he was yet a great way off.</hi> The very intentions and ſecret motions and cloſe purpoſes of our Repentance are known to God: in this ſenſe, he ſees our thoughts afar off; many times God will not ſee the ſinner quickly, but he will at all times quickly ſee the penitent. <hi>I have ſeen him, and will heal him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His preſent commiſeration, [His father ſaw him, and had compaſſion on him]</hi> When <hi>Ephraim</hi> repented, and returned and lamented, why the Lord ſaith, <hi>My bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him:</hi> So here, the father not only ſees but compaſſionates. <hi>q. d.</hi> Look, the poor child is at length come back, he hath ſmarted enough, he ſhall be welcom, I will forgive him all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His gracious Acceptation,</hi> expreſſed in three particulars:</p>
               <p>One of <hi>ſpeedy readineſs [The father ran.]</hi> Mercy muſt ſpeed to embrace a penitent: Swift are the feet of mercy to a return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner.</p>
               <p>A ſecond of <hi>wonderful tenderneſs [The father fell on his neck].</hi> How open are the arms of mercy to take a penitent ſinner into
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115664:8"/> the boſom. Mercy hath not onely feet to meet us, but arms alſo to claſp and receive us, if we be penitent.</p>
               <p>A third of <hi>ſtrong affectionateneſs [His Father kiſſed him].</hi> God hath not onely arms, but lips; he hath not naked mercies for a penitent, opening themſelves in manifold promiſes onely; but alſo ſugred mercies, mercie ſealed with the kiſſes of his lips, with a ſweet teſtimony that he doth accept of, and is reconciled to a penitent and returning ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things on the Childs part, which is <hi>the real acting of his former reſolution in an actual confeſſion,</hi> verſ. 21. And here observe a ſtrange interruption on his fathers part:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſtaies not to hear all the confeſſion and petition inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though he have purpoſed to have ſaid more <hi>[and make me as one of thy hired ſervants.].</hi> Why! the father ſtops him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents him; we propoſe a method many times, but God ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes in with his mercies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He cannot confeſs ſo much, but the father, though not in words, yet really doth much more; Fetch forth, ſaith he, 1. <hi>The beſt ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. 2. The pretious ring,</hi> and 3. <hi>The comely ſhoo's.</hi> We can bring nothing to God, but yet he can find enough for the whole ſoul: And 4. <hi>The fatted Calf.</hi> Ah! how infinitely different is the penitent condition from the impenitent: Now the child hath garments, hath ornaments, hath neceſſaries, hath comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables; when we once truly turn to God, we ſhall find no lack; there is a complete happineſs now come to this returning ſon, who adventured on the gracious diſpoſition of his father: and there is a great gladneſs now in the father, for the penitential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of his ſon. Our condition is beſt, and God is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when we turn penitents, <hi>verſ. 21, 22. Let us eat and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for this my ſon was dead, and is alive again; he was loſt, and is found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus briefly have you the ſenſe of the Parable, with a diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chief heads thereof: I will nov proceed to pick out the moral obſervations which are couched in it, they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three general head.</p>

This is the literal part of the Parable: But the Moral part comprehends (if I miſtake not) theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Sin is a departing from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Prodigal, he muſt leave his Father, he muſt be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>D.</hi> 1. Sin is a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God</note> gone, what doth it imply, but the ſinner is a departer? Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is a departing; we leave God when we betake our ſelves to a courſe of ſinning. Thus is it ſtiled in Scripture, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Ah ſinfull Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, children that are corrupters; they have forſaken the Lord, they have gone away backward.</hi> Here ſin is called a forſaking the Lord, and a going away, and a revolting, <hi>ye will revolt more and more:</hi> which is a falling off untruſtily from God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>They have forſaken me the fountain of living waters.</hi> Heb. 3. 12. <hi>An evil he art of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a two-fold Departing; One is <hi>real,</hi> when he turns away from the place or preſence of another, as <hi>Jonathan aroſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A two-fold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting. Real.</note> 
                  <hi>and departed from his father Saul.</hi> Thus no man can depart from God; for he being omnipreſent, is with us in every place: Another is <hi>moral,</hi> which is, when the heart or ſoul departs; and thus the ſinner departs from God, when his ſoul and affections leave him, <note place="margin">Moral.</note> and cleave to ſin. And it cannot be but that ſinning ſhould be ſuch a departing, for as much as God and ſin are moſt contrary, ſo that the ſoul cannot enjoy them both; if you will love and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your ſins, you muſt leave God; and if you will love and follow the Lord, you muſt leave your ſins; for <hi>what communion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115664:9"/> can there be betwixt light and darkneſs,</hi> God and ſin.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this may <hi>inform us</hi> of the <hi>madneſs and folly of a ſinner,</hi> He will live in ſuch or ſuch a ſin, and with greedineſs he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> See the folly of the ſinner,</note> follows the inticements thereof: Well! thou enjoyeſt thy ſin, but conſider that thou loſeſt thy God; and what doeſt thou get in all thy delights, which are but <hi>lying vanities,</hi> whileſt thou <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakeſt the God of thy mercies?</hi> Thy exchange is miſerable, to leave a God, and embrace a ſin; to depart from the chiefeſt good and happineſs, and to make choice of the baſeſt objects of ſin, which is worſe then hell it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A ſecond moral obſervation is this, that <hi>A ſinner doth volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, of his own accord, depart from God.</hi> Here the Prodigal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>D.</hi> 2. A ſinner doth voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God.</note> makes choice of his own way and courſe, and deſires to be left to himſelf, and to take his own courſe. God compels no man to a ſinfull courſe, nor is he the cauſe thereof, nor can Satan compel the heart. A man in this regard is ſaid to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>entice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and with <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>ſell himſelf to work wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, The <hi>ſinner is utterly inexcuſable</hi> before God, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Therefore the ſinner is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</note> his mouth is for ever ſtopped, his ſin and perdition is of himſelf. God is cleared in Judgment, who puniſhes the wicked who is the actor, contriver, and ſole cauſe of his own ſinnings. Take any ſinner who delights himſelf in a way of wickedneſs, why! he is voluntary in it: 'Tis true, in diſpute he pretends an inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or inability, but the real cauſe of his ſinning is his own will, for he <hi>loves Darkneſs rather then Light,</hi> and had rather ſerve his Luſts then God; he makes choice of them before God, as the multitude did of <hi>Barrabas</hi> before <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and when Life and Death, God and Sin are propounded, yea, and that with the true rewards from the one, and ſevere wrath from the other, yet he like <hi>Iſſachar bowes down under the burthen, and loves reſt;</hi> he had rather go on in his ſins, and will not leave them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alone are guilty of our own bloud, God is innocent as well as juſt, our condemnation is but a due guerdon or paiment for our own voluntary departings from God.</p>
               <p>A third moral Obſervation is this, that <hi>The pleaſures of ſinning will quickly end, and the end of them is extreme miſery.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The pleaſures of ſin will quickly end in miſery.</note> here will be gone, he muſt have pleaſure, his Fathers houſe was too ſtrict; well, he begins his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iotous living, but then you read that he quickly conſumed and waſted all his ſubſtance, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115664:10"/> brought himſelf into ſuch extreme neceſſities, that he became a ſervant to the ſwine, and fain would have fed his belly with the husks which they left, but none gave unto him. This point I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more fully to preſs, which contains in it two branches: 1. <hi>That the pleaſures of ſinning are but ſhort. 2. That though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures begin a ſinfull courſe, yet extreme neceſſity and miſery or ſtreights do end it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The pleaſures and delights of ſinning are but ſhort:</hi> The rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous life of the Prodigal was a preſent conſumption of his eſtate. <note place="margin">The pleaſures of ſin are but ſhort.</note> The pleaſure of ſin is like a Candle, which in the very burning and lighting burns and conſumes away. It is in Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the <hi>crackling of thorns,</hi> which is but a ſpeedy blaze; and to the Lightning, which is but a glance and a flaſh and away; and to a ſeaſon, <hi>the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11. which is a very inch of time, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a little article of time; for though time be long, yet a ſeaſon is but a ſhort ſpace. In <hi>Job</hi> the pleaſure of ſin is compared to <hi>a ſweet morſel;</hi> a morſel is no great quantity, and though it be ſweet, yet it ſlips quickly away from the tongue and palate. And the Apoſtle compares it to a <hi>bait</hi> wherewith a fiſh is taken; the fiſh looks on, and nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a little, and takes it down, and then away goes the bait. <hi>Cain</hi> pleaſed himſelf a while, but not long; for the ſin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſently purſued and cried againſt him: And <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, had but one taſte of the forbidden tree, it quickly ſet his teeth on edge: <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s gold and garments, and <hi>Achan</hi>'s wedge, as they were ſtoln waters, and though ſweet, yet ſhort. So was it with <hi>Ahab,</hi> he got <hi>Naboths vineyard</hi> ſinfully, but he ſcarce ever enjoyed it; he met with a mighty curſe from God preſently upon him.</p>
               <p>But here obſerve, that the pleaſures of ſin may be ſaid to be <note place="margin">In reſpect of eſtimation.</note> ſhort, 1. In reſpect of <hi>eſtimation:</hi> when the hearts of men judge of them as falſe, unlawfull, and ſhort. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> eſteemed of them, and therefore <hi>refuſed the pleaſures of ſin, which were but for a ſeaſon.</hi> 2. In reſpect of <hi>duration:</hi> For if Life itſelf be not long, <note place="margin">In reſpect of duration.</note> the pleaſures of ſin muſt needs be ſhort. It is true, that as long as the impenitent ſoul hath a being, the guilt of his ſin ſhall have a being and conſiſtence in the ſoul, but at the utmoſt ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures extend not beyond our life, their date then of neceſſity muſt be expired, though uſually they are extinguiſhed or interrupted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115664:10"/> before, and life is a very ſhort tale, hour, moment. 3. <hi>In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In compariſon with eternity.</note> 
                  <hi>with eternity;</hi> though a man ſhould live in the pleaſures of ſin 20, 40, 60 years, yet what is that ſpace of time to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſorrows and bitterneſs. Compare the longeſt time with eternity, it is ſcarce a conſiderable moment. But you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Why ſhould the pleaſures of ſin be ſo ſhort? <hi>Sol.</hi> Nay <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> you might rather demand, Why they ſhould be at all? for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed real pleaſure cannot ariſe out of ſinful acts, yet a carnal and ſenſual pleaſure there is, which is nevertheleſs ſhort: Becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sin is never ſo pleaſant, but it breeds that which is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sin is never ſo pleaſant but it breeds that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant.</note> 
                  <hi>unpleaſant;</hi> nay the more pleaſure we find in it, the more diſpleaſure it works; like a draught of beer, which the more fully and pleaſantly drops down, the more danger is added to the patient: So is it with ſin, it ſeems a delightful thing to you to follow your luſts, your evil waies; but the more you ſin, the more you increaſe your guilt; and guilt is but a ſword to cut the throat of your ſinful pleaſures; It is like ſweet poiſon, which goes down eaſily and delightfully, but it will ſuddenly diſturb and crack the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath curſed the waies of ſin;</hi> and therefore though they <note place="margin">God hath cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ways of ſin.</note> ſeem pleaſant for a while, yet that ſhall not be long, he hath hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it with thorns, threatned all evil, miſerable and judicial evil againſt it. And look as when a good man earneſtly preſſes God upon his promiſes, his ſorrowes ſhall not ſtay long, but ſighs and tears ſhall flie away: So when a wicked man provoketh God by his ſinnings, his pleaſures ſhall be ſhort, for the Lord will perform his threatnings againſt him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The pleaſures of ſin muſt neceſſarily be ſhort, becauſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Conſcience cannot be long quiet.</note> 
                  <hi>cannot be long quiet:</hi> If you ſhould wound and wound a man, he will begin to feel, and to complain; even your pleaſant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are the moſt grievous woundings of conſcience, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not bear, it will awake with blood trickling, and will be revenged of you with moſt bitter expoſtulations, ſevere accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unſufferable gnawings, and then where are the pleaſures of your ſins? <hi>Who can ſtand before envy?</hi> ſaid <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſo againſt conſcience, the wounds thereof, yea and her woundings by it, <hi>who can bear?</hi> thy delights will ſink and flie off, yea thy heart will fail thee utterly, when conſcience ariſeth to accuſe and condemn thy ſinful pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115664:11"/>4. <hi>They raiſe up manifold afflictions and calamities which ſhorten our pleaſures and delights.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">They raiſe up manifold affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But I proceed to the opening of the ſecond branch, <hi>viz. the endings of ſin.</hi> That though a ſinful courſe may begin in many <note place="margin">Sin will end in many miſeries.</note> pleaſures, yet <hi>it ſhall end in many miſeries, extremities, and ſtraits.</hi> There are diverſe ſorts of ending of things: ſome end by way of <hi>annihilation,</hi> as the ſouls of the beaſts, they ſhall ceaſe to be, they are reſolved into nothing; ſome end by way of <hi>perfection,</hi> as the ſouls and waies of holy men, Glory and Salvation is their end; ſome end by way of <hi>corruption,</hi> as when the beauty of a thing is marred, or a goodly body is turned; and ends in a loathſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs, or ſweet Wine turns to ſharp Vineger. After this manner doth ſin end, or a ſinful courſe end: as it was with the day in which <hi>Sodom</hi> was deſtroied, it began with the <hi>pleaſant light of the Sun,</hi> but it <hi>ended in fire and brimſtone:</hi> Thus was it with thoſe ſinners, their delightful flames of luſt ended in horrid flames of Vengeance. There are two ſorts of ſorrow and trouble: one <hi>Penitential,</hi> and the other <hi>Judicial;</hi> one of theſe ſin muſt end in. <hi>Achans</hi> wedge pleaſed his eie, but it loſt his life. <hi>Ahabs</hi> deſire was ſatisfied to get <hi>Naboths Vineyard,</hi> but his blood paid for it in the <hi>portion of Jezreel. Gehazi</hi> obteined the <hi>garments</hi> and <hi>talents,</hi> and at the end a <hi>Leproſie</hi> to his dying day. <hi>Judas</hi> gets favour with the chief Prieſts, and money to betray his Maſter, but he got horrour of conſcience, final deſpair and damnation for his treachery. <hi>The young man</hi> in the Proverbs is inticed with the filthy flattery of the <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 17.</note> Whore, <hi>her bed was perfumed with Myrrhe,</hi> but <hi>her houſe is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death;</hi> thoſe chambers <note place="margin">17.</note> of delight prove chambers of death.</p>
               <p>But to open this in ſome particulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. To what extreme miſeries and ſtreits may ſin bring the ſinner? <hi>Sol.</hi> 1.

The Apple, the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Apple, which if taſted had death in it, was yet goodly to <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> to look on, <hi>it was pleaſant to the eyes.</hi> And the Wine of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, though it <hi>bit like a Serpent, and ſtung like an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 31, 32</note> yet <hi>it looked red, and gave its colour in the cup.</hi> As all ſins have after their commiſſion ſomething to back them, ſo they have before their commiſſion ſomething to enter them: After our ſinning, there are corrupt defences and reaſonings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſinnings, there are corrupt pleaſures and delights: As in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115664:12"/> the ſewing of a Garment, there is a Needle to make way, and then a Thred to keep faſt; ſo it is in the conſtitution of a ſinfull courſe, there is pleaſure to make way for the ſin, and then there is love and defence which keeps faſt the ſin. Therefore we muſt in this be informed, not to entertain any thing becauſe it doth pleaſe and delight us, for uſually that is ſinfull which at firſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; it is not how it pleaſeth me, but how it pleaſeth God: The ſoul of man naturally is very corrupt, and as it is with ſome ſtomacks which are foul, the worſt diet is moſt delightfull, ſo it is with our ſouls being evil, therefore that which is evil ſuits beſts with them and pleaſeth them moſt. Pleaſures of any thing muſt be judged by 1. <hi>A Word of truth;</hi> for if they be not good, as well as pleaſant, they are ſins factors; and 2. by <hi>the reſpondency they have to a nature,</hi> not as corrupt, but as <hi>renewed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſin is not onely bad, but politick; not onely unlawfull, but deceitfull.</hi> As it is with ſome faces which have natural wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, <note place="margin">Sin is not onely unlawfull, but deceitfull.</note> theſe are dawbed over with painted gloſſes; or with ſome bodies which are crooked, theſe are bolſtred out with ſecret ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; or as with rotten wares, theſe are glazed over with gaudy dyings: So is it with ſin, in it ſelf a foul thing, a loathſome and odious thing (therefore in Scripture called an <hi>abomination,</hi> a <hi>filthineſs,</hi> a <hi>vile thing,</hi> a <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> a <hi>rottenneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſore, putrifying ſore,</hi> &amp;c.) yet it draws on the ſinner by pleaſure and delight. Sin doth not move us nakedly as ſinfull, but cunningly as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; it doth not tempt the young man to uncleanneſs, and tell him, that <hi>whoremongers and adulterers God will judge;</hi> but <hi>come, let us take our fill of love, I have perfumed my bed,</hi> &amp;c. as the ſtrumpet in the Proverbs: It doth not tempt the perſon to drunkenneſs, and tell him that no drunkard ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God, and that there is a woe belonging unto him; but it ſhews him the redneſs and colour of the Wine, and ſuggeſts the ſweetneſs thereof unto him. So in ſins of murther, it doth not ſhew that revenge which God threatens, but that acceptable revenge and way of eaſe which the ſinner delightfully thinks on. As <hi>Balak</hi> ſent to <hi>Balaam</hi> the rewards of Divination, and then deſired him to curſe <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And that <hi>Apocalyptical whore</hi> had in her hand <hi>a golden cup,</hi> and within that the <hi>wine of fornication:</hi> So deals our ſin with us when it tempts us, it doth hide the hook, and ſhews the bait; it conceals the obliquity, and repreſents the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115664:13"/> beauty; it covers the miſery, and ſhews onely the pleaſure, to draw and inſnare our ſouls.</p>

Conſcience galls me, fears cruſh me, God abhors me, the world doth not help, friends cannot eaſe me; what I feel is bitter, and what I fear is worſe: Ah my ſins, you ſaid I ſhould have pleaſures ſtill, you ſaid that I ſhould not ſee miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, you ſaid that God would be eaſily mercifull, you ſaid theſe were nothing, you ſaid that to morrow ſhould be as to day, and much more abundantly: Ah that ever I truſted you, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you, yielded unto you; you have deceived me; by a little pleaſure I am now brought into, and left in the midſt of all miſery: Ah, you ſins which were once ſo pleaſant, can you not deliver me? can you not comfort me? do ye forſake me? is this your kindneſs? is this your delightfulneſs? where is it?

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto ſin: now though miſeries are contrary to the <hi>ſinner,</hi> yet not to the <hi>ſin;</hi> they are contrary to the ſinners eaſe and way, but not to the affection and delight of ſin, which may, and oft times doth live and remain even under extreme miſeries. Now then, many men are in miſeries by reaſon of ſin, yet they turn not from ſin, becauſe they want true grace, by the ſtrength of which alone men come off from ſin, for that it is which changeth the ſinfull heart. You know that Phyſick ordinarily works as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, into which it is received; there muſt be ſome ſtrength of nature to help it, elſe it will not work; the Philoſophers rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> The heat which melts the wax, hardens the clay; and the juice which goes into the Roſe makes it ſweet, but that which goes into the Nettle makes it ſtink; ſo it is with miſeries, they work as he is on whom they fall; if true grace be not in the heart, what good uſe can an evil heart make of them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Becauſe ſtraits and miſeries are ſometimes meerly judicial,</hi> onely the ſtrokes of revenging Juſtice. You know, that <note place="margin">Straits are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meerly judicial.</note> there is a great deal of difference 'twixt a whip which cauſeth ſmart, and a plaiſter which cauſeth healing: All miſeries which befall us are not healing plaiſters, ſometimes they are judicial laſhes, they are not the wounds of a friend, but of an enemy. God is ſaid in <hi>Job,</hi> to <hi>diſtribute ſorrows in wrath,</hi> and then they are not remedial effects, but exitial; they come not then with their teaching and recovering aſſiſtance, but are the beginnings of a greater judgment yet to come. You know that God plagued <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> in a judicial way, the miſeries which befel him were as ſharp, and great, and many, and came as thick as moſt that ever befel any man of whom we ever read; nevertheleſs they were ſo far from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115664:17"/> reclaiming of him from his ſins, that ſtill he hardned his heart, and exalted himſelf; If you ſhould demand why it ſhould be thus with him, that no, not quick, nor great, nor many plagues did him any good? I anſwer, One cauſe, amongſt many, is this, Becauſe they came onely in a judicial way; they did not come out of the hand of a mercifull Father, but of a provoked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Judge: If there be not grace in the heart to joyn with, and to improve the affliction, and if there be not mercy to ſend out and bleſs the affliction, it will then never do us good, it will not turn us from our Sins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>The Heart of a Sinner may be above his miſeries:</hi> There is not ſuch a power in miſeries alone, as to over-rule the <note place="margin">The heart of a ſinner may be above his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> heart, or to mend it. As it was with <hi>Gallio,</hi> when the Jews did beat <hi>Softhenes,</hi> and kept a ſtir, the Text ſaith, <hi>He cared not for any of thoſe things: (i.)</hi> they made no prevailing impreſſion on him, ſo as to divert his purpoſe: In like manner may it be with the miſeries which perſonally befal a man, his heart (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) may not regard them, neither may he lay things to heart, they may be thrown off, in reſpect of any beneficial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as water from a rock; as is evident in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and in the Jews, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 25. <hi>He hath powred upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battel, and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> Here was anger, and fury of anger, and poured out, and ſo as to ſet him on fire, and to burn him, yet he laid it not to heart. If you ſhould take droſs and corrupt ſtuff, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, you ſhall never refine it, it is to no purpoſe, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſuch a caſe would melt but in vain, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 29. ſo in this caſe: For the proper operation of all miſeries is onely moral, and rather re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Look as it is with the Light of the Sun, though great and gentle, yet it never opened a blind mans eyes; nor yet the Lightning, which runs ſwiftly in the time of Thunder: For that natural privation exceeds the ſtrength of ſuch Agents. So it is with a ſinner, his heart may ſo cleave to ſin, that neither the Light of the Sun, I mean the bleſſed Word of God, nor yet the Lightnings and Thunders of afflictions may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115664:18"/> him; ſo great may the power of ſinfull love be, that not the kindeſt mercies, nor the ſharpeſt miſeries (alone) ſhall ever be able to melt him, or turn him. The love of ſin may increaſe even an incorrigible and deſperate perverſneſs in the Will; ſuch perverſneſs, that the afflicted ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sin can live and rule whiles the ſinner is under miſery, but it never can do ſo when he is under grace. You know that a man never can turn from ſin, but when he loves holineſs; now holineſs is that which many a ſinfull heart, like <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, perſecutes to the death. Why! if ſome ſinfull hearts will venure the loſs of heaven, rather then they will be holy, will they not rather then endure the loſs of friends and eſtate? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if they will adventure the pains of hell rather then they will come off unto an holy life, will they not rather endure ſome temporal diſtreſſes? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth not this ſhew, that ſome had rather be paſſive in miſery, then active in holineſs?</p>

Yet it is not always ſo:

Were you not in great fears, in great griefs and troubles of mind? need I ſay, in great Proteſtations and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes? But now I demand of you, Have your great ſtraits brought you off from your great ſins? did they not find thee in a ſinful way, and do they not now leave thee walking in that path? Ah! and muſt the Lord ſay of you, They refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction? <hi>they turn not to him that ſmites, yet have they not returned to me; they will know no ſhame; they are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſilver; they are not refined nor purged; their ſcum is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;</hi>

                  <hi>hardned himſelf againſt God, and proſpered?</hi> ſaid <hi>Job</hi> 9. 4. his meaning is this, that ſinning is no proſperous and thriving way. It cannot be, that a man ſhould go on in ſin, and yet meet with proſperity and good ſucceſs; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>He that hardneth his heart, ſhall fall into miſchief.</hi> Pro. 28. 14. So that ſinning is not onely not proſperous, but it is alſo miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; it will do a man a miſchief ſomtime or other. <hi>Can a man ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grapes of thiſtles?</hi> ſaid our Saviour: It cannot be; for thiſtles produce bloſſomes according to their kind, of a filthy and ſharp
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115664:22"/> quality: But as for Grapes, which are of a ſweet and refreſhing and delighting nature and virtue, they come not from ſuch a root as a Thiſtle. Comfort, and bleſſing, and peace, and proſperity, and good ſucceſs, theſe cannot grow from a ſinfull courſe; the land of ſin is always a land of famine and barrenneſs, and watered onely with clouds of wrath, and ſet with thorns of vengeance, a land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a perſon muſt not look to ſee good. So that what the Lord ſaid of <hi>Coniah, Write that man childleſs,</hi> the ſame may be affirmed of every ſinfull way; It is a barren, an accurſed, an unprofitable, an unſucceſsfull way: No way to better, but the onely way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe wrath and puniſhment to the ſinner.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, ſin is not onely a barren thing, unable to produce <note place="margin">Sin is a very provoking thing.</note> any good or bleſſing, but ſin is alſo a <hi>very wicked thing,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking.</hi> The ſinnings of men, are the provocations of God to wrath and puniſhment, and the more ſinnings, are ſtill the greater provocations. <hi>How long</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites) Will they provoke me?</hi> Look as the froward and perverſe walking of a child provokes the parent <hi>(i.)</hi> ſtirs up his diſpleaſure and anger: So the ſinnings of men, they do provoke the Lord by them unto jealouſie and wrath, and ſtir up his diſpleaſure againſt them; therefore it cannot be, but that if men go on further in ſinning, they ſhould find a worſe thing of it; for every ſinning is but as it were a further kindling of the fire, and a new incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and provoking of the Lord; and the more that the Lord is provoked againſt a ſinner, the more miſery and puniſhment is the ſinner like to feel from God.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>No puniſhment which any ſinner hath already felt, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,</hi>

We may not think, that becauſe God doth for precedent ſinnings afflict and judge the ſinner in ſome particular kind, therefore he is now ſecured and diſcharged for the time to come, as if God did not intend to reckon wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular demonſtrations of Gods wrath, are no acquittances, but rather certificates of a fuller wrath yet behind. <hi>If ye yet ſhall walk contrary unto me</hi> (ſaith God to the Iſraelites, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 21.) <hi>I

               <p>4. Nay, do but conſider the <hi>Nature of divine Juſtice,</hi> and this will clear it to be ſo. Divine Juſtice appears in two things, one in <note place="margin">The Nature of Divine Juſtice.</note> an <hi>Homogeneous Retribution,</hi> if I may ſo phraſe it, <hi>according to the quality of actions and perſons. If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doſt ill, ſin lyeth at the door,</hi> ſaid God to <hi>Cain;</hi> there is an acceptance upon well doing, and vengeance for evil doing. The juſt God will recompence every man according to the quality of his work; ſo that in this regard the ſinning perſon, who doth not change his ſinful work, muſt look for no other pay from God at any time, but the wages for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work, which the Apoſtle aſſures us in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. is tribulation and anguiſh. Another is, <hi>A proportionable Retribution according to the extenſion of actions or works;</hi> and therefore you read of more ſtripes according to the greatneſs of the fault in the knowingly diſobdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſervant. Now, as it were againſt the natural retribution of Juſtice, to give unto the wicked as unto the righteous; ſo it were againſt the proportionable retribution of Juſtice, to repay either no puniſhment to a greater ſinner, or leſs puniſhment for greater ſinnings; That when he continues worſe in ſinning, he ſhould either proſper at all, or that the puniſhment ſhould be more mittigated, when the offence is more raiſed and aggravated.</p>
               <p>5. Laſtly, <hi>God would hereby teach all men, that no time, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, is ſafe to ſin:</hi> Before puniſhment come, it is not ſafe to ſin; <note place="margin">To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>each that no time is ſafe to ſin.</note> for we ſee that ſinners do pluck down puniſhments, and as it is with the winds, which bring the clouds, and fly away; yet the clouds pour themſelves down on the earth; ſo the ſins which bring out the threatnings of God, though in reſpect of particular facts, they are gone, yet the threatnings pour down many a curſe and miſery upon ſinners: and when puniſhments are off, it is not a ſafe time to ſin, foraſmuch as God is ſtill as ready to puniſh, as men are forward to ſin; as we may ſee in the Iſraelites, whoſe <hi>pride and murmuring</hi> cauſed the <hi>earth to open her mouth,</hi> and to <hi>ſwallow up Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> &amp;c. And the next day when they <hi>murmured</hi> again, God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115664:23"/> ſent the <hi>Plague</hi> amongſt them, which ſwept away many thouſands of them; for as time is not allowed to ſin, ſo no time can at all ſecure the ſinner from puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now againſt all this truth it may be objected, <hi>That we do not allwayes ſee it ſo:</hi> that men after puniſhment, making <note place="margin">We do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſee it ſo.</note> progreſs in ſin, find it to prove a worſe work, in reſpect of greater miſeries and ſtraits. Nay, Secondly, We ſee oftentimes the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer to the firſt part of the Objection, That you <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh Betwixt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and Certain pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> muſt diſtinguiſh,</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Twixt <hi>immediate puniſhment,</hi> and twixt <hi>certain puniſhment:</hi> It cannot be denyed, but granted, that a worſe puniſhment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not alwayes immediately unto the adventurous ſinner: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes God doth ſhoot an other arrow of puniſhment, as ſoon as the ſinner ſhoots up a ſecond arrow of rebellion; as you read in the Iſraelites caſe of murmuring; I ſay, ſometimes God doth thus, but alwayes he doth not ſo. Sometimes he doth ſo, that ſinners might know his Juſtice can be quickly even, and meet with a daring ſinner; but alwayes he doth not ſo, becauſe that even great ſinners might confeſs ſomewhat of his great patience. Nevertheleſs, there is a certainty of a worſe miſery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the progreſſive ſinner; for as when God defers a Mercy, it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comes down in a cluſter; ſo when God defers a Judgment, it ordinarily falls down in a thunder: he is therefore in the Pſalms ſaid to <hi>whet his ſword.</hi> The whetting of the ſword is but a time of preparation, and a putting on a ſharper edge to give the deeper wound; ſo, &amp;c. and he is ſaid to be righteous in recompenſing vengeance, therefore there is a certainty of a worſe puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Twixt <hi>Viſible</hi> puniſhment, and <hi>Real</hi> puniſhment: though to the eye of others, a man may ſeem either not to be puniſhed <note place="margin">Betwixt Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Real puniſhment.</note> at all, or leſs now in his continued ſinnlngs then before: yet the perſon may be more really puniſhed then before; the miſery upon him may be a greater miſery, not for the quantity of the thing, but for the quality of his affection to the thing; for that evil is alwayes moſt grievouſly miſerable unto us, which meets us in our higheſt way of Love, or cloſeſt ſuſpicion of fear. And again, the greatneſs of the puniſhment is as God mingles more wrath in the conſcience at the time. Even a little outward miſery, if it be joyned with a greatly accuſing and condemning conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115664:24"/> is a miſery, more then all other miſeries beſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Yea, but <hi>we do ſee,</hi> that wicked men, who do continue their ſinnings more after their puniſhment, <hi>that their conditions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>are ſo far from being worſe, that they are moſt merry and proſper? Sol.</hi> 1. <hi>This is not always true, but onely in ſome,</hi> and but for ſome <note place="margin">

Theſe very <hi>things prove to them very ſore judgments;</hi> for by the abuſe of them (like an ill ſtomach, which gathers a ſurfeit upon good meats) they do more increaſe their ſinnings, and the wrath of God. 3. <hi>Firſt or laſt they ſhall know that it ſhall not be well with the wicked,</hi> and that between a former puniſhment and a greater there may ſtep in many mercies, as twixt the fits of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſome real ſlumbers and pauſes.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to the Application of this Point, which ſhall be for <hi>Conviction.</hi> 1. Of the <hi>vanity and deluding preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                  <hi>in the heart of ſinners,</hi> who imagine, that worſe they cannot be, and as much miſery is befallen them as can be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will on to their ſins again. Let us not deceive our ſelves; that God with whom we are to deal, is of infinite power and wrath, and the conſcience of a guilty ſinner is capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely many miſerable impreſſions. The Bee may leave her ſting in the fleſh, and ſo be diſabled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore let no man ſay as <hi>Agag, Surely the bitterneſs of death is paſt;</hi> you know <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> preſently <hi>hewed him in pieces before the Lord in Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gal.</hi> Alas! thou knoweſt not the wrath which is yet behind. God doth never fully manifeſt his wrath upon any ſinner in this life; nor doth he puniſh him ſo in any kind, but that a greater judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>a worſe thing,</hi> as Chriſt ſpake to him in the Goſpel, may yet befal him. Conſider, that as greater judgments are yet behind all the puniſhments which we have felt; ſo it is Gods method to begin low, but to end his work of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heavily: he doth by ſome lighter afflictions skirmiſh with a perſon, or a Nation, and if they yield not, then he will bring the great Army of his Plagues and Judgements. And again, know, that multiplication of ſins is a juſt cauſe for the addition of Judgements. Renewed ſinnings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the more hainous, and ſtrong in deſerts; but renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinnings after puniſhment for ſin, are yet of a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dye, becauſe <hi>They reliſh much of Preſumption;</hi> though God hath already teſtified his diſpleaſure, yet the ſinner
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115664:24"/> will adventure on his wrath, and provoke him again. They <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive univerſal condemnation,</hi> the ſinner now ſins againſt all the waies of recovery; the <hi>Word of God</hi> which called upon him to be wiſe, and to receive inſtruction, and to return unto him that ſmote; <hi>The puniſhment or rod,</hi> which did tender him the ſins which brought this upon his back; The <hi>mercy</hi> of God which drew off the wrath, and though it might have been a deſtroying ſword at once, that deſtruction ſhould not have riſen up the ſecond time, yet it ſo wrought with the maſter, that he would try the ſinner yet a little longer, thou mightſt have been among the dead, yea among the damned for thy former ſinnings, yet mercy hath ſo tempered juſtice, that time is left thee to repent, and this ſpace thou abuſeſt to ſin again; yea, though juſtice met with thee for them already, yea though mercy releaſed thee yet a little longer, yea though thou didſt confeſs theſe ſins, yea though thou wert greatly troubled for theſe ſins, yea though thou didſt reſolve againſt theſe ſins; and if thou thus ſinneſt more, will not thy puniſhment be greater? Doth not God hate ſins now as well as then? Or if thou be greater in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, will he be leſs in juſtice? Canſt thou expect mercy ſhould come more eaſily, when ſin is raiſed more deeply. <hi>He that being often reproved hardneth his neck</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 29. 1.) <hi>ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroied, and that without remedy:</hi> The ſame may be affirmed of being puniſhed; uſually perſeverance in ſin after pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, brings a ſudden and a ſore deſtruction. God hath many arrows which flie over the heads, and after that hee hath arrows to wound the hearts of his enemies. You know that there be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warning-pieces, but murdering-pieces in the roial artillery. The puniſhment which a man hath already felt for his ſins, are but ſo many warning-pieces to repent, to return from ſin; but if men will harden their hearts, there are murdering-pieces; God can ſo deeply ſtrike, that deſtruction ſhall not riſe up the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond conviction ſhall be of <hi>Duty:</hi> If the further <note place="margin">Conviction of duty.</note> men go on in ſin, the worſe rhey ſhall ſpeed; then let us learn a double duty; 1. To avoid ſuch things as will occaſion a further progreſs in ſin after puniſhment. 2. To apply our ſelves to ſuch <note place="margin">Avoid,</note> waies as may take us off from ſinning being puniſhed. 1. <hi>Vitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> The things which we muſt avoid as occaſioning a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in ſin are theſe 1. <hi>Ignorant Miſconſtruction;</hi> as if Gods <note place="margin">Ignorant miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction.</note> arrows did flye out as his, who ſhot at an adventure, and lighted

               <p>3. <hi>Froward Impatience:</hi> when perſons are ſenſible of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but vex againſt God, who ſtrikes ſo cloſe, yea and like that <note place="margin">Froward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience.</note> King in the ſtrait, <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> When men will forſake God becauſe hee doth puniſh them, this is a further ſin, and makes way for more ſinning. The ſoul, which is moſt apt through a murmuring impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to queſtion God, will be apt through a preſumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ſin againſt God; in the dead ſea there is leaſt ſailing, and in the raging ſea, there is moſt ſhip-wracking.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Empty confeſſions,</hi> when perſons ſatisfie themſelvs with words, and a meer form of Repentance, putting on for the time a grave <note place="margin">Empty confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> countenance, and fetching a ſigh, and dropping a tear, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that all is not well; but all this while they ſearch not to the root, they do not ſtrive to examine their hearts, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, to cleanſe and reform them; and what then can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but upon ſome convenient occaſion the old heart ſhould return to its old waies and courſes? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> confeſſed <hi>that he and his people had ſinned,</hi> but ſtill he hardned his heart, and would not let Iſrael go: Hypocritical humiliation or repentance, becauſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from mutable cauſes, laſts not long, nor changes the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul. The ſore which is but covered and not cured, will break out again.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Negligent remiſſions:</hi> An heart which likes not to change its courſe, may ye for the obtaining ſome ſpecial good, give out <note place="margin">Negligent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</note> unto the doing of much good, and for the removal of ſome evil, make a ſtop of much ſin. You may obſerve, that ſometimes in the heat of a puniſhment, how our hearts (perhaps) fall down before the Lord, and we are very urgent on him, and very diligent; ſpend much time in his ſervice, and a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115664:25"/> kind of watchful tenderneſs is come upon us againſt ſin, but then we let fall our hands, and our candle quickly burns more dimly, our task abates, our affections grow ſlack, our purpoſes, our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wear away, and we begin to grow as forward to our ſins as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: the liking of God, and of his waies and ſervices cool, and ſinful occaſions grow as pleaſing and acceptable. Remember it, that man will be quickly bad, who grows negligently good, and the ſoul which is weary of Gods ſervice, is ready for ſins work.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Partial reſervations;</hi> when men in or after puniſhment will <note place="margin">Partial Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</note> profeſs againſt the great bulks of ſin; and as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (at length) was willing to let the people go, but to ſtay the little children, ſo we wil bid defiance, and ſeem to take reſolution againſt our former great iniquities, in the greatneſs of them, but yet we will keep back and not part with ſuch and ſuch things, which perhaps formally are not ſinful, but occaſionally they may (to our corrupt affections) prove ſo. Why! how can it be but ſuch a ſoul ſhould make yet a progreſs in ſin, who reſervs ſtill an incendiary motive, a quick and captivating incentive unto ſin? The river will quickly over-ſpread and fill the channel if you give it way: ſpare but your ſelf in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and they will bring on firſt the leſſer trials of ſin, and the leſſer trials will quickly ingage you to greater adventurings, and ſome adventurings will eaſily bring you to your old courſes.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place let us <hi>apply our ſelvs to ſuch waies as may</hi>

                  <hi>take us off from ſinning, yet more after puniſhment,</hi> which you have heard doth make the condition yet worſe. The directions which I would commend unto you, are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In all puniſhment for ſinning follow the writ, open it, and ſee</hi>

                     </gap> Cauſe.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe name is in it;</hi> my meaning is, enquire into thy ſelf, ſearch diligently for whoſe ſake this evil befals thee; as the <hi>Mariners</hi> in <hi>Jonah</hi> concerning the tempeſt, they did caſt lots, that they might know for whoſe cauſe that evil was upon them; ſo ſhould we in the preſence of our puniſhment, when Gods hand is in any kind upon us, ſearch and lift up our hands unto God, to ſhew us the ſpecial reaſons of his wrath and indignation; for though earthly parents do many times inconſiderately in paſſion chaſtize their children after their own pleaſure, yet God doth it wiſely and never without cauſe; we may ſay of all our puniſhment what the Prophet ſaith to the Iſraelites, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115664:26"/> theſe things unto thee, this is thy wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments never prove reformations, until firſt they be informations; they never cure the heart, unleſs firſt they clear the eye: We muſt firſt ſpell the Leſſon, before we can take it forth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this do, if thou canſt not find the ſpecialty of thy provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 1. Look thy afflictions and puniſhments well in the face; perhaps thou mayeſt in them ſee the very feature of thy ſin which hath cauſed God to puniſh thee; very uſually, that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is a Rod, is alſo a Glaſs, it ſhews us the fault for which we are laſhed. 2. Obſerve thy ſelf in the eſtate when thy puniſhment doth come; do but recal thy bent of heart, courſe, ways, imagination, devices; ſometimes a man is taken by the puniſhment, when he is dealing in a way which doth more eſpecially provoke God. 3. Peruſe the Word, and well conſider what ſins have brought down ſuch kind of puniſhment. <note place="margin">Pares culpae. Pares poenae.</note> God doth many times keep his courſe of the ſame puniſhments with the ſame ſins; elſe the Apoſtles dehortation of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> from Idolatry and Uncleanneſs, which was the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſins, for fear of the like puniſhments, were ſomwhat vain. 4. Laſtly, Regard the firſt and more frequent verdicts of thy own conſcience. There are two times when Conſcience deals more home and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with us: One is, when we are to die; Another is, when we are to ſuffer; in a time of judgment and affliction, we find, as <hi>Joſephs brethren</hi> did, the remembrance of former evils, <hi>Surely this is befallen us becauſe of our brother,</hi> &amp;c. ſaid they: So our hearts tell us, Well, aſſuredly this comes upon me for my Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for my Drunkenneſs, for my Uncleanneſs, for my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>ſpends all,</hi> yet he returns not; he is <hi>pinched with famine,</hi> yet he returns not; <hi>he joyns himſelf with a Citizen,</hi> and he ſends him <hi>to feed Swine,</hi> yet doth he not return: if he could have got but the husks which the <hi>Swine</hi> did eat; husks are but poor, empty, light things, miſerable nouriſhment; but if he could have made any ſhift, any way to have ſupported himſelf, he would not have returned unto his Father. Thus you read of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that though there were a Climax of plagues upon him, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ruine upon his Land, and Cattel, and Servants, riſing like a Tide and Flood, yet till it came to his firſt-born, and the next ſtroke was to reach his own life, he would not obey the Voice of the Lord in letting of Iſrael go; like obſtinate defendants in a City, which will loſe one Outwork after another, and ſuffer the Undermining of their Walls, ere they will come to terms of Capitulation. So we read of the Iſraelites before the Captivity, how extremely they did endure a very ſucceſſion of Judgments, and variety of ſtrange puniſhments before they would return? Amos 4. 6. <hi>Cleanneſs of teeth, and want of bread; yet have they not returned to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>Rain was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,</hi> and great ſcarcity was there of water; yet, Ver. 8. <hi>Have ye not returned to me.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Smiting, with blaſting, and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew, and the Palmer worm, yet,</hi> &amp;c.

And all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs devourings of the ſword, and all the kinds of deſtroying ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, did not turn them to the Lord againſt whom they had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but after all, they ſpend the utmoſt of their pollicies for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, running into <hi>Egypt,</hi> flying unto <hi>Aſhur;</hi> they tryed all ſorts of fruitleſs confidences, before they would return unto the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115664:28"/> Lord, therefore doth the Lord threaten to <hi>hedge their ways with thorns, and to make a wall that they ſhall not find their paths.</hi> Hoſ. 2. 6. <hi>(i.)</hi> he would caſt them upon ſuch a condition that they ſhould not go any further, or if they did, they ſhould have little eaſe, they ſhould walk as upon thorns, upon continual prickings and woundings; and all this muſt be done before they will <hi>return to their firſt husband,</hi> verſ. 7. Now for the clearer opening of this Aſſertion, conſider of theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is to be underſtood of the natural temper of the ſinner.</hi> The ſinner may be conſidered two wayes under extremities: <hi>As</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This is to be underſtood of the natural temper of the ſinner.</note> 
                  <hi>effectually aſſiſted by the preventing grace of God,</hi> which is of ſurpaſſing vertue to renew the ſoul, and to conquer its ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and averſneſs, and effectually to perſwade and draw in the heart to yield unto God, and to give up its weapons of luſts. The which grace (if God infuſeth) at any time whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, or under, or after afflictions, then the ſinner doth not wander in the paths of perverſneſs, nor doth he hold out ſo long, but in ſtead of trying all ways to continue in his ſins, he will ſpeedily aſſay all the ways to be freed from them. <hi>As left unto his own corrupt ſpirit,</hi> and the projects, contrivances and ways there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And thus it is with him, like a beſieged enemy, which will retreat from hold to hold, and diſpute every inch of ground, before he will give up the City: So is it with the ſinner, his heart will deviſe one defence after another, and he hath yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhift, though he be many times hardly beſet in his name, or in his eſtate, or in his body, yea, or in his conſcience. And God doth narrowly watch over him, and doth ſpoil him of his many falſe confidences, and deals more ſmartingly with him to yield and return; yet he hath not onely much ſubtilty of ſpirit behind to delude all, but alſo he hath exceeding ſtubbornneſs of ſpirit to oppoſe all the means which are uſed for his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh of the ways whereby God doth deal with a ſinner;</hi> which are of two ſorts: Some are <hi>Victorious ways,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh of the wayes whereby God doth deal with a ſinner.</note> wherein the Lord undertakes the conqueſt of the heart him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the immediate power of his own grace, to pluck down ſtrong holds, and to caſt down high imaginations; upon which, as the converſion of a ſinner doth infallibly enſue, ſo likewiſe preſently and ſpeedily; for this way exceeds the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115664:28"/> ſtrength of rebellion in ſin, and in deſpite of it overcomes the heart. It is the ſtronger man diſpoſſeſſing, and the ſtronger hand pulling us out of the powers of darkneſs. Others are <hi>Moral wayes,</hi> which conſiſt onely in external means; not in the infuſing of grace, but rather in the propoſal of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations thereto by counſel, reproof, threats, rewards, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding this propoſal with ſome or many miſeries: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>That a ſinner will uſe all the wayes and methods ere he will return from his ſins,</hi> is to be underſtood onely, when God deals with him in a moral way, by the preſence of means onely, (not otherwiſe) for which his corrupt heart may be too ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh of turning from ſin:</hi> It is two-fold, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh of turning from ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>Hypocritical,</hi> and feigned; and thus many times at the firſt, upon the very denunciation of a Judgement, as <hi>Ahab;</hi> or upon the perception of it, as <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> when his hand was ſtruck; evil men may ſeem to confeſs, and to grieve, and to forſake ſin, and to ſeek unto the Lord, and pretend to ſerve him. <hi>Real,</hi> and ſolid; when the heart is truly affected with a ſound deteſtation of ſin, and the occaſions thereof; and with a ſincere affection of love to God, and endeavour of new obedience. Though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may be acted by the ſinner without the applying of himſelf to the utmoſt extremities, yet the latter is not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are <hi>two ſorts of ſins in a perſon:</hi> Some which are more <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> either for the profit, or for the pleaſure of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <note place="margin">There are two ſorts of ſins in a perſon.</note> they are not the favourites: Others are more <hi>ſpecial,</hi> which are wrought into ſingular affection; the cuſtome of practiſe, and the much experience of their damnable delights and revenues have exceedingly indeared the ſoul unto them. Though a ſinner might more eaſily be upon parting terms with an unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, an unſerviceable ſin; yet when the divorce is to be made twixt him and his ſpecial luſt, the ſin of his love and affection, the ſin which lies in his boſome, this he will not eaſily part with. A man will endure much pain ere he will part with his right hand, or ſuffer his right eye to be pluckt out; he will ſtir much, and rage much, and project much, and adventure much, ere he will be perſwaded to let this <hi>Benjamin</hi> go from him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There are two kinds of ſubſiſtence:</hi> One is <hi>comfortable,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">There are two kinds of ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</note> a perſon hath many ſupports, even of a chearfull and a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115664:29"/> living, his cup runs over, and his head is anointed with oil. Another is <hi>ubſolute,</hi> when there is no more then to keep ſoul and body together: The propoſition is true, even in this latter ſenſe, That a ſinner, though God doth ſhave off and ſuſpend all the comforts of his life, and doth reduce him ſo ſhort, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more then upon what he can live, if there remains but any one ſprig on which he can take hold, if he can deviſe any one method of ſafety, ſo that he may imagin I ſhall yet live and be ſafe, though I go on in ſin, he will not turn in unto God now, and leave his ſins, but will live the baſeſt of lives, rather then he will relinquiſh the worſt of lives (a ſinful life) he will walk in rags, and beg his bread, and leave all his friends, and become an out-caſt, and a compariſon of the moſt ignoble and infamous wretches, rather then, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This propoſition <hi>holds true of all ſorts of extremities: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This true of all ſorts of Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> in thoſe of conſcience; a ſinner oft-times will rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſharp edge of the Word, which ſpeaks nothing but wrath and bitterneſs, yea he will live under the galling Items, ſevere frowns, bitter accuſations, intolerable ſcourgings, and terrours and condemnations of his conſcience, though his conſcience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times upbraids him in ſociety, amazeth him aſleep, terrifies him in the dark, condemns him for a wretch, and claps on him the apprehenſions of Hell, which makes the foundation of his ſoul to quake, yet it falls out frequently that he will not turn from his ſinful courſe. <hi>Outward</hi> in all the kinds of miſery. A mans ſinful wayes may be like the putrifyings of the hody which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the worms, that eat it out, and conſume it: ſo the ſinnings of a perſon many times do rot and conſume his name, yea, all his eſtate; yea, all his amity; yea, all his ſtrength, and yet through the affectionate combination of his heart with ſin, he may rather indure infamy, ſcorns, poverty, deſertion of friends, famine and nakedneſs, any thing rather then he will leave his ſin; the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed know no ſhame. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did not ſet his heart for all this, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, This is true not only in a <hi>tranſcient and paſſionate</hi>

                     </gap> becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſin is leſs evil then miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But becauſe, The ſinner doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly love his ſin.</note> then that ſhall be forſaken. But, 1. <hi>The ſinner doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love his ſin:</hi> The heart of a ſinner is ſet on his ſin; he hath made a <hi>Covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.</hi> He loves darkneſs, and is held faſt with the bonds and cords of his ſinful affections. A perſon doth many times ſuffer pains ſharper then death, becauſe he doth exceedingly love life: Why? a ſinner loves his ſin as he loves his life; nay, more then his life, the which he doth often hazard for ever to preſerve his ſin. 2. <hi>The ſinner is a Fool:</hi> Put a fool never ſo oft in the Stocks, it doth <note place="margin">The ſinner is a Fool.</note> him no good; he underſtands not the cauſe nor end of it. Evil men are chaſtized and puniſhed by God, but they know not nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; they know not that their ſins are the cauſe thereof, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115664:31"/> that Converſion from ſin is the end thereof. 3. <hi>There is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſtout Spirit of pride in the ſinner;</hi> who is therefore ſaid to <note place="margin">There is a ſtout ſpirit of pride in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> fight againſt God, and to reſiſt him; and though he be ſmitten, yet to refuſe to return, and wilfully to tranſgreſs, and that they will not hearken. Stifnecked are they called; and foreheads have they which cannot be aſhamed, and faces that cannot bluſh. 4. <hi>A vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">From a vaine preſumption. that yet their ſinful wayes ſhall be well at laſt. From the Contrariety betwixt the wayes of God and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners heart.</note> 
                  <hi>that yet their ſinful wayes ſhall be well at laſt:</hi> It is but bearing a while, and at length their calamities will off. He who goes on in a ſinful way, is never without ſome ſinful project and chimeraes; ſilly fancies of ſome good, and ſome ſupport and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his troubles, &amp;c. 5. <hi>There is a bitter contrariety twixt the wayes of God and the ſinners heart.</hi> Light and darkneſs are not more oppoſite; hence is it that in <hi>Job</hi> they ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledg of the Almighty.</hi> And in Pſal. 2. <hi>They break the cords in ſunder.</hi> And Heb. 10. <hi>They are ſaid to offer deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Holineſs and holy walking, ah! it is that which their hearts hate more then hell; they will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their damnation, before they will affect and practice holineſs; no greater burden and torment to them then it. 6. And ſometimes <hi>Unbelief</hi> may be a ſpecial cauſe, why a ſinner doth thus ſhift and <note place="margin">From unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</note> try. The guilt of his ſins under his afflictions may lie heavy upon his conſcience, and he may be ſo wholly taken up with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of wrath and judgment and an implacability in God towards him, that God will never ſhew him mercy, who hath been ſo much and ſo long provoked, that it is in vain to return, now there is no hope. 7. <hi>The Vanity of a corrupt Judgment,</hi> which deludes <note place="margin">From the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judgment.</note> the ſinner, as if he could be ſinful and ſafe; or that he could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt well enough without returning to God.</p>

                  <hi>when at firſt he calls upon us to leave our ſins, and to return unto him.</hi> A thing may be reputed precious, partly, in reſpect of <hi>the neceſſity of it,</hi> when it doth ſo nearly concern us, that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done without it. Now what ſhall become of us, unleſs we come off from our ſins? What is it that we ſo ſhuffle for, and will not let it go? What! is it a good in it ſelf, or a cauſe of good to us? and what is it that we ſo hold off from? is it not Grace and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>I ſhall periſh with hunger,</hi> ſaith the Prodigal.

In reſpect <hi>of the excellency of it:</hi> Excellent things are truly precious. Now every grace is excellent, it hath a native beauty in it, and makes us a choice and eſtimable people. Do throughly weigh a penitent and converted condition, how in it we are partakers of the Divine nature; what a communion we have thereby with God; what a fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt; how we paſs from death to life, are made the ſons of God, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115664:33"/> become the heirs of glory, and will we then thus deviſe and flie from our beſt good; Why! when the Lord offers grace to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what doth he therein but offer himſelf to be his God, offer Chriſt to be his Saviour, offer the pardon of all his ſins, offer all the comforts of his Spirit, the bleſſings of his promiſes, and the hopes of eternal life; and if this be not an excellent thing, what is? can a better or greater matter be tendred to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord will not alwaies be calling upon us, nor tendring repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life,</hi> and which brings forth ſalvation, as the Apoſtle <note place="margin">The Lord will not alwaies be calling upon us.</note> ſpeaks; <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.

They ſhall never enter into his reſt; and this the Lord binds with an Oath. Every one of theſe is a Judgment ſufficiently fearfull; for, what ſhall become of the ſinner, when the Lord ſhall (judicially) draw off the means of his Converſion? or if the means be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in common to others, yet he will not work any more upon that perſon through them; but he ſhall deſpiſe the counſels of the Word, and ſlight the meſſage of all Afflictions; and that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould run ſo far and ſo high in a way of wickedneſs, that the Lord gives him over as a deſperate, hopeleſs, and forlorn wretch, to walk in his own counſels, and after the luſts of his own heart; and when the Lord ſeals him up by his Oath, that this is a perſon who ſhall never ſee my face; though many a ſinner ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſaved, yet this ſinfull Tranſgreſſor ſhall never enter into my reſt: Now what doth the ſinner know, who ſeeks new ways to ſecure his ſinning, and oppoſeth thereby all the ways which God uſeth for his converting, I ſay, how doth he know, but that the Lord will deal thus with him. God hath dealt ſo with ſome, for dealing thus with him; he cloſed up the day upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and left the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to their own hearts luſts, and never anſwered <hi>Saul</hi> any more, neither by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor by Dreams, and threatens to remove the Candleſtick, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115664:34"/> be not difficult to God, yet the far running ſinner ſhall find it, for his part, a more intricate and hitching thing, to wind his heart from thoſe acts and paths of iniquity, into which it hath been ſo long accuſtomed. However, it will <hi>be the Harſher;</hi> the child which ſticks ſo often in the birth, cauſeth the birth to be <note place="margin">Or the harſher.</note> more ſharp and dolorous. Uſually, the more ſinfull a man hath been, and the longer he hath held off God, his ſoul is more cut; partly with <hi>Fears,</hi> for now he hath many doors to unlock ere he can faſten on grounds of comfort; not onely that he hath held on a courſe of ſin ſo long, but alſo that he hath ſo ſubtilly and frequently withſtood the tenders of grace, and Gods manifold dealings with him already. Though the perſon may have grace truly wrought in him, to make him ſee all this vileneſs, yet it may be long ere his faith ſhall be able comfortably to apprehend Gods mercy to forgive it. He may have doubts, not onely of mercy, but of the truth of his converſion, as if it ſeemed rather to be compulſive; God may long withhold from him the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his love, who hath a long time perverſly withheld the conſent of his heart from returning unto him. Partly with <hi>Shame:</hi> It will be an exceeding reproach and confuſion of face unto this perſon, when ever the Lord converts him, that he ſhould deal with the Lord thus, reſiſt his Spirit ſo much, and withſtand that great kindneſs of God intended to him by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means which he hath uſed. <hi>Surely, after that I was turned, I repented,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>after that I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> Ezek. 36. 31. Ah! how it will rent and preſs the ſoul! Such a fool, ſuch a beaſt was I, to purſue my own ruine, to reject my own mercies, to ſlight ſo great ſalvation, to vex ſo good a God, and to be ſo infinitely, unthankfully baſe, that if I could have found any means of ſupport, I would never have ſubmitted unto him, and left my ſinfull courſe: Ah! how doth the Lord take this at my hands? how unacceptable may my returning now be, which may ſeem rather to be forced through extremity, than to ſpring out of any ingenuity. So that you ſee, by our ſinfull ſhiftings, either God may deny us converting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115664:34"/> grace, or elſe we ſhall make our Converſion much leſs eaſie and comfortable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, What can we help it? can we turn our own hearts? it muſt be the Lord who muſt do that; and he <note place="margin">We cannot convert our ſelves.</note> might do it at the firſt as well at at the laſt, if he would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> And is this excuſe to paſs for currant? hath not God dealt <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> with thee often? didſt not thou more often harden thine own heart, willingly withdraw thy ſelf, and all out of a love to ſin? 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I would commend theſe five Directions. 1. Strive to <hi>be convinced of this, That as long as the Courſe is a ſinfull Courſe, it</hi>

                  <hi>can never be a ſafe Courſe.</hi> We may weary our ſelves in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our imaginations and ways, but run what courſe you pleaſe, and purſue your own devices, yet this ye ſhall reap of the Lord, you ſhall lie down in your ſhame and ſorrow; you may run to new experiments, but miſery will follow your ſins the next time as well as this, and in every way as well as one way: <hi>Your ſins will find you out;</hi> and as long as you carry your ſins with you, you cannot keep off calamities from you.</p>
               <p>2. Of neceſſity <hi>you muſt return or periſh:</hi> Your ſinfull courſe is <note place="margin">You muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn or periſh.</note> a by-path, and leads to death. It is ſinfull, and you know it; and being ſinfull, it muſt be miſerable.

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115664:35"/>
               <p>3. <hi>It cannot but be beſt, the ſooner it is:</hi> I muſt return, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; too ſoon I cannot return, and the ſooner the better.

               <p>
                  <hi>That nothing ſhall avail the ſhuffling ſinner, until he doth turn from his ſins; but God will diſappoint all his projects, batter down all his confidences, fruſtrate all his expectations, drive him out of all his harbours, and overthrow all the means and ways which he flies unto.</hi> Before I confirm this Aſſertion, let me premiſe a few particulars, that ſo you may rightly conceive the ſcope of it. Thus then.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I intend the Aſſertion, of a ſinner whom God doth intend to convert; others he may leave to proſper in their imaginations: For you ſee it raiſed from the diſappointment of a Prodigal, one whoſe converſion at length attended his manifold afflictions, and as manifold contrivances to keep up his ſinfull converſation: though ſuch a perſon knows not it, nor thinks on it, yet God is ſecretly againſt him, and thruſts him off from all the Cities of Refuge, unto which he flies; which way ſoever he turns, and what courſe ſoever he applies himſelf unto, whatſoever veſſel he puts himſelf into, it ſhall be like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s <hi>ſhip,</hi> which will not be quiet until he be caſt out, until he doth come to conſider of his doings, and return.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I intend the Aſſertion, <hi>of an eventual, not of an inſtantaneous</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is intended of an even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>diſappointment: (i.)</hi> Though for the preſent, and ſome ſhort ſpace, the cunning ſinner may quietly poſſeſs the fruits of his projects, and ſolace himſelf in ſome carnal ſecurities; yet at length, ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God will again beſiege him, and take him off. As it was with <hi>Adonijahs gueſts,</hi> though for ſome minutes they did feaſt and rejoyce, yet on a ſudden they were all amazed, fled and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; or as it is with the Fowls which are purſued, though they light, as they think, upon a prey, yet the Piece is diſcharged, and they are all driven away: So is it with the ſinner (whom God intends to convert) though he may contrive a way (as he thinks) and quietly and ſafely go on in his ſinfull
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115664:36"/> courſe, and begin to ſit down, yet thither alſo will the Hue and Cry come, and he ſhall be forced away; all that alſo ſhall be daſhed in pieces; there will come down a Writ of Ejection, and caſt him out of the houſe, as it did <hi>Ahab</hi> out of <hi>the Vineyard</hi> which he had unjuſtly poſſeſſed; ſo that he ſhall not ſettle long upon any way or courſe, without ſome ſpecial and effectual diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from God.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſhuffling projects of a ſinner ſhall be invalid ſeveral ways.</note> 
                  <hi>when that every thing or way which he contrives is raſed and ſlighted:</hi> As a Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

One of theſe ways doth God make the ſhuffling projects of a ſinner unavailable; either by blaſting that vain Gourd which delightfully ſhadowed him; or by turning off the ſinner from the Horns of thoſe Altars, unto which he flies in times of miſery; or elſe by making the land of Egypt, into which he flies for Bread and Corn, to become an Houſe of cruel Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; I mean, by turning his deſires into, if not Curſes, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Croſſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the <hi>cauſe</hi> why <hi>the ſinner doth ſhuffle,</hi> be <hi>inward,</hi> or <note place="margin">The ſhuffling ſinner ſhal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep down ſtrokes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor keep off affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> whether it be <hi>outward;</hi> whether it be <hi>the ſtrokes of Conſcience,</hi> or whether it be <hi>the ſtripes of Affliction;</hi> he ſhall neither <hi>keep down the one,</hi> nor <hi>keep off the other,</hi> but the inward wounds ſhall ever and anon be renewed. As all the endeavours of the Mariners could not calm the Sea, until <hi>Jonah</hi> was caſt out of the ſhip; ſo until the ſinner forſakes his evil ways, there is no eſcaping the one or the other.</p>

                  <hi>great mercy unto him;</hi> it is one of the greateſt judgments, when the Lord lets the ſinner alone, to go on and proſper; a miſerable thing it is, when the patient is given over, and no Phyſician will meddle with him; ſo on the contrary, It is a great mercy, when the Lord doth not give over the ſinner, but ſtill follows him, and ſtill diſappoints his counſels, and undermines as it were his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and is too hard for him in all his waies. Thou doeſt oft times take it heavily, that the Lord ſhould ſtand againſt thee thus, and pull away this comfort, and ſtop up that way, and diſappoint and defeat one enterpriſe after another: Why! now conſider, were it kindneſs to let thee make up thy works to hold out againſt God? Were it a mercy to thee, to let thee grow ſtrong in a way of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? The Lord is ſtill againſt me, ſaieſt thou, I can ſet on no way, but I find him my adverſary; I cannot ſettle on any thing, but he plucks it off: I anſwer, The Lord is not ſo much againſt thee, as thou art againſt thy ſelf; it is true, the Lord hath not yet done with thee; Why! becauſe thou haſt not yet done with ſin? and his hand is ſtill ſtretched out againſt thee, Why? becauſe thy hand is ſtill ſtretched out againſt him; he doth by variety of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and croſſes ſtill purſue thee; but let me tell thee one thing, It is better he ſhould purſue thy ſins, then thy ſoul; let the afflictions be what they will, they are better then damnation; all that God intends unto thee is onely this, he will never leave thee, untill he hath overcome thee; as they in the war take one
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115664:38"/> out-work after another, untill the beſieged do yield up: So is it with the Lord, he will drive thee out of all thy holds, as he did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> out of his Kingdom, untill he hath brought thee to humble thy ſelf for thy ſins, and repent. And what is all this, but a moſt tender mercy which doth thus purſue thee, onely that it may ſave thee.</p>
               <p>2. Then <hi>it is in vain to ſtrive againſt God,</hi> to hold out, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall avail: <hi>Are we ſtronger then he,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle? Can <note place="margin">It is in vain to ſtrive againſt God.</note> our counſels lie hid from his wiſdome? or can we ſet upon the waies where his eie cannot find us? Can we graſp the comfort at all, which his hand cannot inſtantly pull from us? Can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ourown ſafeties, whilſt he is diſpleaſed with us? or proſper at all while he ſaies, Curſed is every fruit of thy labour? Can any way of thine enable thee againſt him who can crack a whole world at once? thou canſt repoſe thy ſelf on none but creatures, and hadſt thou them all, what were they, could they ſecure thee againſt their Lord? Is there any creature a Caſtle ſtrong enough to retein a ſinful traitor againſt God.</p>

Laſtly, then <hi>let us ſpeedily return,</hi> and at once take forth the leſſon of all Gods dealing with us; that which he aims at is our <note place="margin">Let us ſpeedily return.</note> repentance; Let former times and denials and ſubtilties ſuffice us; doth God ſtrike off all thy friends, and lay them aſide? doth he pull thee out of every harbor? do all the means on which thou truſtedſt forſake and fail thee?

We muſt not deſpair of men, though they be great ſinners; a prodigal, riotous, luxurious perſon begins here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; nor muſt we be quick and peremptory in our final cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them, though (like a ſhip in many ſtorms) they hold on their ſinful courſes after many dealings, for the power which converts is mighty, and the ſeaſon to convert is different; God
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115664:38"/> doth as it were nurſe up ſome from their youth in grace, others he leaves to conquer in battel; when their deſeaſes are grown to age and ſtrength, yet he can over-maſter and heal them, as here the Prodigal. Concerning whoſe <hi>penitent eſtate</hi> (which was the ſecond General) you may he pleaſed to conſider a double <note place="margin">11. The diviſion of the Text.</note> act: 1.

               <p>I muſt treat next on the firſt work, which is the <hi>judgment of the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, A ſerious conſideration [he came to himſelf] (i.)</hi> now he began to bethink where he was, and what he had done; like a <note place="margin">A ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> mad man before he ſtill raged, and ran on, never minded any thing but his ſins, but now his reaſon comes into joint again, hee ſoberly and in good earneſt conſiders of his courſe and eſtate.</p>
               <p>

Where might ſuch a poor famiſht creature find a bit of bread to ſave his life; Now I think on it, I have a father living, and he hath bread enough, even his meaneſt ſervants have enough, and to ſpare; he hath bread for ſervants, will he have none for a child? they have enough, I have none at all; they have to ſpare, and I hunger, I periſh with hunger, my condition is moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, their condition is moſt plentiful; Well! thus I will not reſt, I will ariſe and go to him, &amp;c. Before I handle that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the text will immediately afford, there may be many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115664:39"/> not unuſeful obſervations, which occaſionally and collaterally fall in: I will but mention them unto you, and then ſit down upon the principal intention of the Verſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That great afflictions may end in a ſweet converſion; or, the ſharpeſt miſeries, may prove a means to bring us to the ſweeteſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may end in a ſweet Converſion.</note> 
                  <hi>mercies:</hi> Storms, though they be to ſome ſhipwracks, yet they landſome; the prodigal met with famine, and that brought him back to his fathers houſe for bread. <hi>I had periſhed,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I had periſhed;</hi> ſo may many a man ſay, Had I not been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, I had been damned; my great loſſes have proved my greateſt gain; I never fell into the love of God, untill I came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſcourge of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That even a great ſinner is not uncapable of mercy or grace;</hi> a luxurious prodigal, who ſpent all among Harlots, is <note place="margin">A Great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of mercy.</note> now returning home to his father, a penitent and grieved child: and the reaſon is this; Though the ſins of a man be great, yet the mercies of a God be free, and mercy advanceth its own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when it ſhines on the greateſt ſinners. Sin is great, but grace is ſtronger, it can quicken dead men. As the knottieſt wood, when it is ſquared, proves of ſtrongeſt ſervice; ſo the vileſt ſinner, once converted, proves the faithfulleſt and activeſt inſtrument of glory to God; and laſtly, God doth extend grace to great ſinners, that no ſinners might deſpair.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That God doth many times permit the ſinner to try to the utmoſt, and then converts him.</hi> A long ſeaſon ere ſome return: <note place="margin">God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permits the Sinner to try the utmoſt, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts him.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> to breath out perſecutions, and to get authority to bind all, &amp;c. and then he is ſtruck down; hereby he magnifies his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and more demonſtrates his mercies and goodneſs, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, hee will yet accept of ſuch a ſinner, and pardon him.</p>

               <p>

What this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is.</note> 
                  <hi>eſtate of a ſinful Condition, with the happy eſtate of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted condition, are the prime ſteps and occaſions of a true and ſpeedy Repentance.</hi> For the Explication of this point, I muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſome particulars; 1. Concerning a <hi>Serious Conſideration of a Sinful Condition:</hi> It is an <hi>Intentive work of the Judgment, wherein it doth narrowly and diligently meditate on the whole eſtate of ſin.</hi> It is called in Scripture, a remembring of our wayes; and ſometimes a bethinking of our ſelves, and a ſeeing what we have done, a pondring of our paths. It is oppoſed not only to Ignorance and Neſcience, but alſo to Negligence; yea, to raſhneſs and ſuddenneſs; and indeed it is a very deep ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and minding, and weighing of matters: When a man ſits down and muſeth, ſo that his mind and thoughts are throughly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, he makes it a ſpecial buſineſs, he bends all his ſtrength rightly to inform himſelf, to bring himſelf to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his eſtate; this is a proper conſideration. There be two kinds of thoughts and mindings: ſome are only <hi>Intuitive;</hi> they are but the caſt of the eye, a glancing, lightning motion. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are <hi>Diſcurſive,</hi> fully ſearching; the mind in them doth throughly inſiſt on the Natures, Kinds, Circumſtances, Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Iſſues of things, it is taken up with it as a buſineſs. The ſerious conſideration of a mans ſinfulneſs, falls into this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it is not a confuſed work, or a light overly ſight of ſin, it is a ſetled and deep pondering of the eſtate in the Qualities, Acts and Fruits of it; Nature, Number, Circumſtances, Danger: <hi>v. g.</hi> 
                  <q>When I ſeriouſly conſider of my ſinful eſtate, I reflect on my ſelf, what kind of life I lead, what are thoſe qualities, what thoſe wayes which I find and walk in: my Thoughts, my Affections, my Speeches have been thus; and thus my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thus my courſe of Life. I have many bonds upon me to ſerve the Lord, and not to ſin againſt him; but, Wretch that I am, I ſee all my ways (which I took for pleaſures and profits) have been ſinful and vile. By them all I have violated a righteous Will, diſhonored and provoked a great God (whoſe wrath is a conſuming fire) I have (to ſatisfie them) loſt all my comforts, cauſed many evils to others, brought many miſeries on my ſelf, put Chriſt to death, and, if God be not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, loſt my miſerable ſoul for ever. Theſe wayes (will I
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115664:40"/> not believe mine own eyes?) are extremely ſinful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſhould I not believe the Scriptures) are damnable: many a year have I run this courſe, and often times under checks of Conſcience; very much evil hath already been upon me, and all for ſin; ſome troubles of Conſcience: And that wrath which God threatens and is behind, is terrible. If I go on thus, I periſh for ever; for whilſt I keep my ſins, the leaſt ſin of them, I muſt neceſſarily part with God, and loſe my ſoul. Tell me, O my vainly deluded ſoul, can that be good which God hates, or ſafe, which God doth curſe? Wouldſt thou dye thus? O then thou dyeſt for ever; and why then wilt thou live thus any longer? O thou haſt preſumed too far already; perhaps Patience will bear no longer, and Mercy being often abuſed, may be for ever recalled; and then, thou, O my Soul, then whither wilt thou go? No, no, we muſt no more of theſe forbidden fruits, and no longer muſt we trade in the paths of death; there is a God who hath lookt on thee all this while, and hates thy wayes, and hath ſealed his implacable wrath with an Oath if thou return not: Come, my ſoul, think aright of God, of thy paſt acts, of thy preſent eſtate, of thy future condition; believe me, thy Guilts are many, thy Accounts will be bitter; God hath been ſtill diſhonoured, he will not be mocked; let us return, for we are out of the way of Heaven, and are even upon the brink of Hell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. Concerning the <hi>right Compariſon of the miſerableneſs of a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What this right Compariſon is <hi>Oppoſita juxta ſe poſita,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinful, with the happineſs of a penitent Condition,</hi> I need ſay but little: It is nothing elſe, but after a diſtinct view of either, to ſet the one againſt the other in the Nature, Kinds, Qualities, Concomitants, Ends and Iſſues, <hi>v. g.</hi> 
                  <q>Thus baſe and foul is an In penitent eſtate; thus excellent and glorions is a Converted eſtate; That how oppoſite to God, This how ſuitable; That how odious to God, This how acceptable; That how covered with threats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This how inriched with promiſes; That is a cloud of thunder, This a river of delight; That is a path of miſery, This a way of mercy: in that God Abhors me, in this God loves me; in that I feel his Frowns and ſtrokes, in this I feel his Smiles and comforts; that brings down all Curſes on me, this all Bleſſings on me; In that I ſhew my ſelf a Rebel, and do nothing but diſhonour God, in this a Servant, and in ſome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115664:40"/> meaſure bring him Glory; if I continue in that, farewell all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and happineſs, I periſh with hunger, I am loſt for ever; if I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this, God is mine, Chriſt is mine, Mercy, Pardon, Favour, Comfort, Grace, Heaven, Happineſs, I ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l be ſaved for ever. Now, O my Soul, thou ſeeſt both Eſtates in their Nature, in their Fruits, in their Ends; yea, thou haſt felt the bitterneſs of the one, ſay, Is not Mercy better then Miſery? is not God better then Sin? is not Heaven better then Hell? is not Plenty better then Famine? Life, then Death? O then, ariſe, up, be gone, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh thy courſe of Sin, of Miſery, of Death, of Hell, and ariſe and go by true Repentance unto God, unto Chriſt, unto Grace, unto new Obedience, unto Mercy, unto Joy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bleſſing, unto Life, unto Eternal Life, and that moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third thing is to clear it, <hi>How theſe two are prime ſteps</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How theſe are prime ſteps to Repentance.</note> 
                  <hi>to Repentance; viz.</hi> A Conſideration that a ſinful courſe is moſt miſerable, and a penitent is moſt happy and comfortable; are ſteps, &amp;c. Only premiſe a difference twixt a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and twixt an <hi>Occaſion</hi> of Repentance. The Spirit of God is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> theſe conſiderations are <hi>Occaſions,</hi> and <hi>work by way of argument or means.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">They work by way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Means proved, By Scripture.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That they do ſo, <hi>appears by Scripture,</hi> 1 King. 8. 47. <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves in the Land whither they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Captive, and repent.</hi> Ezek. 18. 28. <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth and turneth away from all his Tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="2">2. Nay, and it is evident in <hi>Example</hi> too: <hi>I thought on my wayes</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 59.) <hi>and turned my feet unto thy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">By Example.</note> 
                  <hi>Teſtimonies:</hi> Like a Traveller, who in a Journey ſtands ſtill and conſiders with himſelf, ſurely this way is wrong, I am out of my way, and then he turns about and gets him into the right way again. So in this caſe, the like may be ſaid for compariſon of an Unconverted courſe, with the happineſs of a Converted and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115664:41"/> penitent condition, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and return to my firſt husband, for then was it better with me then now.</hi> The condition in which the Church then was, was a condition of much miſery and affliction; her way of ſin was <hi>hedged up with thorns,</hi> verſ. 6. and the way of obedience ſhe conſidered of to be a path of mercy, and much proſperity; and comparing the one condition with the other, hereupon reſolves, to <hi>return to her first husband (i.)</hi> to turn unto God by true Repentance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be cleared <hi>by Argument</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Solid Conſideration, and Right Compariſon, are ſteps unto <note place="margin">By Argument.</note> Repentance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Solid Conſideration,</hi> thus: If <hi>inconſideration be the cauſe of impenitency</hi> (or of going on in a ſinful courſe) then <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>

                  <hi>is a proper means and way for Repentance;</hi> for as much as theſe two are contraries, and contrary cauſes produce contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but inconſideration is a cauſe of impenitency, ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note place="margin">If inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the cauſe of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, then conſideration is a proper means for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note>

Now ſolid Conſideration removes ignorance, it opens the eies of our underſtanding, and makes us to ſee and behold that evil in ſin which we never ſaw before; in a right conſideration there is 1. <hi>Lumen ſcientiae.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſcientiae.</hi> 3. <hi>Experientiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Security;</hi> for preſumptuous men will never leave ſin, if they may be ſafe.

No evill ſhall befall us, ſaid they who deſpiſed all warnings to Repentance; but ſolid conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration removes this ſecurity and preſumption; it makes the ſoul to ſee, that as ſin is an evil thing, ſo it will prove a bitter thing; and that the way which is ſinful (of all wayes) is the moſt fearful: it makes the ſinner to behold the Angel with the ſword drawn in the way of ſin; my meaning is, to behold God exceedingly diſpleaſed, the Wrath of God revealed againſt all Unrighteouſneſs, ſeverely threatning, and one who will aſſuredly execute his wrath to the utmoſt, if ſinners will not hearken and return; by no means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2.

For, This breeds ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things that differ.</note> of a penitent and converted condition; that this likewiſe is a ſtept and way to Repentance, may be thus proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Compariſon breeds ſound Judgment in us of things that differ:</hi> All corrupt works are rooted in a corrupted mind; like ill rhumes in the Head, which come from ill qualities in the Stomack; or rather like ſome ill diſeaſes and irregularities in the Lambs, Arms and Feet, which come from unſound humours in the Brain. So it is in this caſe, men go on confidently in ſin, and are taken exceſſively with thoſe poor baits of ſenſual pleaſure and profit, as if there were no other pleaſure, delight, gain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable, or to be found, but in the wayes and ſervice of ſin; as they in hell, think there is no other heaven: Or as fooliſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who conceive no other ſport or delight like a rattle or dirting their hands, &amp;c. But now, when by a compariſon and true ſurvey of either eſtate, it ſhall appear unto the ſoul that all theſe ſinful pleaſures and profits are but ſtolen waters, and at the beſt but for a ſeaſon, they will end bitterly; and on the contrary, That Repentance from ſin makes way for the moſt precious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the moſt living comforts; that it enables a man for a nearer conjunction with the trueſt happineſs, and fulneſs of moſt infinite goodneſs, and lets in to ſuch pleaſures and joyes which paſs all underſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the ſoul is reduced to a right judgment, and begins to contemn thoſe falſe, vain, deluding temptations by ſin, and is carried off to another courſe or way which will afford the real, ſolid, ſuperlative advantages in happineſs and comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3.

Another is, <hi>a ſinful conſideration only;</hi> when a man conſiders of ſin in a ſinful way, either to boaſt of it, or to excite his heart to more delight and propenſion to ſin; this is a guilty conſideration. A <hi>third</hi> is a <hi>Judicial conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which ariſeth from the promptings and ſuggeſtions of a conſcience awakened, now accuſing, and condemning, and purſuing the ſinner, both with the remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins, and with the evidence of Gods preſent and future indignation. A <hi>fourth</hi> is, a <hi>Penitential conſideration;</hi> wherein, upon the evidence of ſinning, the ſoul is ſenſible, not to deſpair, which breeds hopeleſs terror, yet to repentance, wherein it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly grieved, and troubled, and diſpleaſed for the ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If the conſideration of ſin be a dry act, ſuch an act as ſets where it riſeth (only in the mind) and hath no influence upon the affections; if it be not a ſympathizing act <hi>(.i.)</hi> ſuch an act as works
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115664:45"/> grief in the ſoul, as well as diſcovery of evil in the mind, it is but a vain thing and never conduceth to repentance; for as it is with mercies received, unleſs the apprehenſion of their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs deſcends to the affections, they never ſtir up thankfulneſs; and as it is with the promiſes, unleſs their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and ſutableneſs come down from the mind to the will, they never excite faith: ſo is it with ſin; unleſs, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it, there be not an operation and influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart to grieve and mourn, it will never prove right and penitential.</p>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt, thou knoweſt thy ſins as well as any man can tell thee: Be it ſo, but if thy heart remain hard, not humbled, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, broken, grieved for theſe ſins, alas! as their unworking faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. ſo thy unaffected ſpeculation of ſin, is vain: but findeſt thou this, that upon the ſerious conſideration of thy ſins, thy heart is humbled and abaſed in thee? that thou art caſt down in the ſenſe of thy exceeding vileneſs? <hi>O wretched man that I am!

If thinking on ſin doth not produce leaving of ſin, it is nothing; if thinking of ſin doth not breed leaving of ſin, then going on in ſin will make you leave think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin: And though we think of an ill way, yet if we do not enter into, and walk in a good way, it is nothing. There is a two-fold leaving of ſin, one which is proper to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Glory; another which is proper to the condition of Grace. I ſpeak not of the former, which is the abſolute diſſolution of ſin; but of the latter, which is an imperfect (though true) ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſin; conſiſting, in <hi>Affection,</hi> wherein the Will is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from ſin; the <hi>evil which I would not do,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: In <hi>Mourning; O wretched man! who ſhall deliver me from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death?</hi> In <hi>Endeavour; willing,</hi> or endeavouring <hi>to live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Heb. 13. 18. There is a purpoſe to walk in new obedience, and an hearty deſire ſo to do, and not to ſerve ſin any longer; and alſo an active endeavour to put off the former converſation, and to crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115664:46"/> To conſider of ſin, and yet ſtill to love it, and ſtill to live in it, to ſtudy to fulfil the luſts of it, to give up our ſelves to the ſervice of it, to walk in darkneſs, to be the ſame in our affections to it, and in our obedience unto it, this is not onely a vain, but a fearfull conſideration: But if, when we have throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of ſin in the vileneſs of it, we are effectually wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ariſe from our ſinfull courſe; O Lord! I have ſinned exceedingly, and done very fooliſhly; I am reſolved to leave this ſinfull way; Lord! help thou me, give me thy grace; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; turn away my heart and eyes, cauſe me to put off my old converſation; enable me to walk and live in newneſs of life. This is an happy Fruit, eſpecially if it hath two other Effects accompanying it, <hi>viz.</hi>

The reſolution to reform, if it goes no further than the ſtrength of the ſoul, it will eaſily cool, and quickly fail us; if ever it prove right, it muſt carry us to Chriſt, for as much as it is by his ſtrength, and by his grace, that we get our hearts turned from ſin, or that we are able to forſake our ſins. Haſt thou conſidered of thy ſins? why and doeſt thou not diſcern ſuch infinite guilt in them, as makes thee for ever accurſed, if thou haſt not mercy in Chriſt? and doeſt thou hereupon apply thy ſelf, in all humbleneſs of heart, to the Throne of mercy? <hi>O Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner; according the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tranſgreſſions:</hi> Behold me through the bloud of Chriſt, yea, O Lord! heal my ſinfull ſoul; O Lord! change my heart; O Lord! diſſolve the powers of ſin in me, by thy mighty power ſubdue my iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; turn me from all ſin, make me a ſervant of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <hi>on?</hi> To this, I conjecture it may be thus anſwered. 1. <hi>That actual or particular inconſideration, if it be voluntary</hi> and <hi>affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth prejudice Repentance:</hi> For it is to be ſuppoſed, that he who will not take the pains to think of his ſins, hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Again, There is a two-fold conſideration of ſin: One is <hi>ſolemn,</hi> wherein the <note place="margin">There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin.

That <hi>ordinary conſideration is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to gradual Repentance.</hi> If ever you would perfect your <note place="margin">Ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> Repentance, you muſt ever think of your ſins, thoſe that are paſt, thoſe that are preſent. By ordinary conſideration, I do not mean, a ſlight and perfunctory view of them; but a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly view, though not in length of time, yet having the ſame diſpoſition of heart to condemn and abhor them, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us more fervently to ſeek God for ſtrength, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the occaſions of ſin, and to grow more watchfull and tender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you do not ordinarily conſider of the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, you will be ordinarily inſnared by the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin; if you would enjoy conſtant victory and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,

Qu. 1. <hi>What is required to enable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rightly to conſider, and to compare?</hi> &amp;c. I conceive thus. 1. <hi>There muſt be knowledge:</hi> Right Conſideration and Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are works of an illightened mind; to underſtand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature and diſtinction of things, neceſſarily requires knwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: For Ignorance can neither conſider nor diſtinguiſh; therefore ſtudy the Word, and other Books, to underſtand what objects are, of which you are to conſider. 2. There muſt be <hi>ſome Wiſdome:</hi> For every Underſtanding cannot find out things, <note place="margin">Wiſdome.</note> nor is able to make their differences of vileneſs or excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the Works of God, that <hi>a brutiſh man underſtands them not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 5, 6. that we ſay
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115664:48"/> of perſons onely enlightened, That if they have not ſpiritual Wiſdome, to compare things, or to conſider of them, they will never, by the evidence of the vileneſs of Sin, or excellency of Grace, be drawn to Repentance. 3. There muſt be <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs,</hi> or Sequeſtration: You muſt ſeparate your ſelves, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Retiredneſs.</note> ſpeaks. Tumults of buſineſs. or violence of noiſe, diſtract the thoughts, and alienate them, utterly diſabling to conſider. 4. You muſt <hi>gather your ſelves together:</hi> You muſt ſtrive againſt diviſion in mind; be carefull to unite and to center your thoughts, <note place="margin">Gathering our thoughts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> not ſuffering your ſelves to be ſcattered, or blown away from your ſelf. 5. You muſt <hi>pray</hi> unto God to open your eyes <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> to ſee, and to give a judgment to diſcern, and to unite your hearts, and enable them to go through the work; for verily you ſhall find much reluctancy and oppoſition of ſpirit, to ſuch a work.</p>

The Rules for right conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Do it in a free time. Do it with a full time.</note> as to occaſion Repentance, are theſe. 1. Do it <hi>in a free time;</hi> there are times, wherein a man is moſt unapt for ſuch a work as this, as when very ſick in body, or under ſome paſſion of grief, or fear, or loſs: Now the ſoul is in a Tumult, it cannot ſee things aright, nor judge aright. Take a calm time for all works of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either to know, or to judge thy Eſtate. 2. Do it <hi>with a full time:</hi> The matter is weighty, not the work of a day, as they ſpake concerning the ſeparation in <hi>Ezra,</hi> it <hi>was not a work to be done in one day.</hi> Nor is this of ſound Conſideration, a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which can be haſtily done, and well done; you muſt do it deliberately and ſeriouſly; for there are many ſins, and many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to be conſidered of, and to be weighed and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Do <hi>it throughly:</hi> Do not begin a little, and then give over; leave not till you come to the bottome; ſee the worſt <note place="margin">Do it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> of it, and the utmoſt of it, if ever you will ſee the good of it: You are never a jot the worſe, by ſeeing how bad you are; but you may be the better all the dayes of your life for it. You muſt be faithfull to your own ſoul, not to paſs over any ſin that you can well conceive your ſelf guilty of. 4. You muſt do it <hi>orderly:</hi> Conſider not of all ſins in a Lump, but break your <note place="margin">Do it orderly.</note> thoughts: And as they in Judgment conſider of one Cauſe, and then of another; ſo do you of your ſins; what are your chief ſins,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115664:48"/> in affection, or practice, or inclination, and ſo go to other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their order, time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. You muſt <hi>do it ſo long,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Do it till your heart begin to Relent.</note> 
                  <hi>until your heart begin to relent,</hi> and grows tender and ſoft: Ah! how vile, and abominable, and wretched, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then ſtrike in with God by Prayer and Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is a way to bring you to Repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Rules for Compariſon.</hi> If you would ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <note place="margin">Rules for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the ſinful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate. Compare them in their proper nature and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> the miſerableneſs of the ſinfull, with the happineſs of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted condition, ſo as to be brought to Repentance, then 1. <hi>You muſt compare them in their proper natures and effects;</hi> not by that which is accidental, but by that which is natural; there may be ſome trouble to a converted eſtate, and ſome delight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unconverted eſtate; theſe then are preternatural, they ariſe not from the things themſelves, but are contingent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents: But compare the real natures and fruits of the one with the other, and then you ſhall ſee reaſon to leave the one, and to chooſe the other. 2. You muſt <hi>compare them by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Compare them by a proper Rule.</note> 
                  <hi>Rule:</hi> not ſtanding, in point of definitive ſentence, what your own heart, or what the World approves; but onely what God in his Word doth ſentence to be moſt vile and miſerable, and what he pronounceth to be moſt good and comfortable. The Rule of Compariſon muſt ever be pure, impartial and perfect. 3. You muſt <hi>have ſo much faith alſo, as to believe what God ſaith</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Believe what God ſaith of either ſtate.</note> 
                  <hi>of either eſtate:</hi> For though you ſhould refer the deciſion unto him, yet if upon his reſolving, you are reſolved to quarrel againſt it, and diſpute the truth and validity, and ſay yet, It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we will not believe that our ſinfull courſe is ſo bad and ſo dangerous; alas! you will never repent while you live: But you muſt reſolve of this, that the Word ſhall captivate your thoughts, and ſhall diſcover, and ſet the differences of eſtates; and ſo you may be occaſioned to repent. 4. You muſt take an <hi>humble and firm reſolution to take and follow that way which God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>

This Reſolution of the Prodigal, is ſet forth, partly by the 1. <hi>Matter of it,</hi> which is very compleat; it contains as much as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <note place="margin">Set forth by The Matter of it.</note> requires, <hi>(Surgam &amp; ibo,) I will ariſe, I will go.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is ſomething facetious upon the words; <hi>Surgam,</hi> I will ariſe, <hi>quia jacebat,</hi> for the Prodigal was down before: Sin is a fall, and Repentance is a riſing: and <hi>ibo,</hi> I will go to my Father, <hi>quia longe aberat,</hi> for the Prodigal was far from home: Sin is a long travel, a wandring rather; and Repentance is a ſweet returning: We go abroad when we ſin, we come home when we repent. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon <hi>Ibo ad patrem,</hi> I will go home to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wittily compares the motions of Repentance to thoſe of a journey. That though which I do moſt conjecture at in the words, is, The Prodigals compleat Reſolution for the matter of Repentance. Repentance is a motion twixt two terms, and is made of <hi>Averſio</hi> and <hi>Converſio;</hi> Averſion from a ſinfull courſe, and that is in <hi>Surgam,</hi> I will ariſe; Converſion to God, and this is in <hi>Ibo ad patrem,</hi> I will go to my Father. 2.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Repentance is a Gradual thing in working.</hi> Though the habitual implantation of it be inſtantaneous, (for it is a Grace <note place="margin">Repentance is a Gradual thing in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> infuſed, and therefore admits not of ſpace and leiſure,) yet the actual operation of it is ſucceſſive, and by degrees; as here in

It is <hi>a well grounded purpoſe</hi> of the will; it is not a houſe without a foundation, nor a ſhip without a bottom, nor yet with a weak bottom; It is not raiſed, I know not how, or on a ſudden, in an irrational and humorous way, or in all haſt: Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, he who will leave an ill courſe in haſt, comes off from it (indeed) with too much leiſure; but it is ſuch a purpoſe, as is throughly bottomed upon ſuch grounds as can give life, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bent and inclination of the will. It doth ariſe from, and depend upon mature conſideration, and upon deep convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The ſinner doth firſt look into, and ſeriouſly peruſe and weigh an impenitent and ſinful courſe, and ſeeth the ſtrongeſt, and forcibleſt, and juſteſt cauſes to renounce it for ever; and alſo upon due trial, and ſearching, and weighing in the ballance of the Sanctuary, he doth find the wayes of new obedience to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and only wayes of life, to which if he doth not turn, he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115664:50"/> cannot pleaſe God, nor be ſaved; and unto which if he doth turn, then he is under the beſt God, and in the moſt excellent and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condition: and hereupon begs of God for grace and ſtrength; and ſo reſolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a Word, the Reſolution is well grounded; when it followes ſerious deliberation, and is raiſed upon divine aſſiſtance, and entred into with earneſt ſupplication; for our ſtrength cannot bring forth, nor maintain ſo great a work as refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>ſtrong purpoſe of the will:</hi> The operations of the will are reputed ſtrong, when either they are not divided, <note place="margin">A ſtrong pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the will.</note> but united; or when they are rooted in an habit or principle, and not only in an occaſion and accident; or when they are abſolute, and not conditional: If the operations be divided, they are weak as Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo when a man partly wills this, and partly that; he is inclined ſomewhat to leave his ſin, and yet he is inclined to keep it; this diviſion hinders right reſolution, which is not ſo indifferent, ſo indeterminate, ſo divided, but centers the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the will, only one way, <hi>viz.</hi> to a peremptory rejection of evil, and a peremptory election of good; the ſoule goes down, and it is not a grain which will turn it: Again, if the operations of the will ariſe only from occaſions which is buſied in alterable circumſtances, they can never be ſtrong; as the colour in the face, which ariſeth from violent exerciſe only, goes off preſently; ſo that reſolution (if it may be ſo called) which ariſeth from changeable impreſſions, is alwayes weak and fading; a deceitful bow, unſtedfaſt. <hi>In their afflictions they will ſeek me</hi> early, but, <hi>&amp;c. Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. But to the production of a penitential reſolution (which makes a ſtrong purpoſe in the will) there muſt be an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit which will ſet the heart, and incline it ſo, that it will not be taken off; as in <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi, Intreat me not,</hi> &amp;c. there was a ſtrong principle of love, which made up this ſtrong purpoſe to cleave unto her. Again, if the operations of the will be conditional, they can never be ſo ſtrong, as when they are abſolute; for a ſuppoſition and caſe, where the will may put off and diſpence with it ſelf, cannot make the act of the will ſo firm as where the caſe is abſolute (for now the whole bent of the will is carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any check or diminution.) If a man ſaith, I will leave ſuch a ſinful courſe, in caſe I may have the countenance of ſuch friends, or the benefit of ſuch an eſtate; and I will lead a godly life, in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115664:51"/> caſe I may hold correſpondence and eſteem in the world, &amp;c. purpoſes upon variable conditions are variable. Theſe conditions do diminiſh the ſtrength of Reſolution; but when a perſon is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in an abſolute way, come what will come, friendſhip or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, greatneſs or poverty, life or death, I will change my courſe; this is a ſtrong purpoſe of will, and a right Reſolution.</p>

Reſolution is not a tranſient paſſion, but it is a fixed quality. Not that it is not interrupted, but that it is not renounced and given over, but is ſtill maintained. Nor that it is not aſſaulted, but that it is not changed. A twiſted Cord, <hi>Propoſiti tenax,</hi> that is a reſolute man, <hi>&amp; ſibi conſtans,</hi> but a double minded man, an unſtable ſpirit, a will, though ſtrong as Paſſion, yet if unſtable as water (hot in the firſt aſſault, as if we would be ſtronger then Men, and flat in the ſucceeding aſſaults, as if we were weaker then Women) theſe humours are rather ſome complements, which ſtill ſhrink at the acting, then reſolutions for change of Life: Paſſions are violent, but not conſtant, as the <hi>Galathians</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, It is an active purpoſe: for as it is a vain thing to <note place="margin">It is an active Purpoſe.</note> deliberate much, and to reſolve on little at length, ſo it is a vain Reſolution which purpoſeth great things, but doth nothing. If I reſolve to take Phyſick for my health, and never take any, what avails that Reſolution? Like <hi>Antigones, I will give,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave. So, if a man reſolve to leave his ſins, but the day is ſtill to morrow; he ſets not upon it indeed, but yet a little ſlumber, yet a little ſleep, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpake of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>cras, cras,</hi> this is vain. But true reſolution is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſtriving; it puts a man upon the work, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, <hi>I will ariſe and goe to my Father,</hi> who indeed did thereupon ariſe and go. I am reſolved to confeſs my ſins, to judge my ſelf, to ſeek unto God by prayer; and I do indeed do ſo, I do confeſs, judge, pray, uſe the means, &amp;c.</p>

We muſt be at a point for all things except what is good, if we be reſolved to be good indeed; no, not Life it ſelf muſt be dearer to us, than that which is far better than Life.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115664:54"/> to be altered and renewed, and therefore it is not impoſſible for any ſin to be ſubdued: Though thy own ſtrength be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet Chriſt's is not; He who hath commanded thee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with Sin, hath likewiſe promiſed to conquer ſin; if thy duty be active, he is able to work in thee both to will and to do; if thy duty be paſſive, he can give thee not onely to do, but to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his ſake; if thou muſt not be leſs then a Sufferer, he can make thee more than a Conqueror: Thy helps are far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thy diſcouragements, there are more with thee than againſt thee: Therefore fear not to reſolve; 'tis a vanity to talk of another, or fitter ſeaſon; you will be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave ſin, the more time you take to commit ſin.</p>

                  <hi>you can.</hi> It is our blindneſs which keeps us in ſervice; and the Will is uſually perverſe, becauſe the Judgment is greatly dark: Did we know ſin aright, (truly, fully, experimentally,) you have attained to Reaſons enough, why you ſhould reſolve againſt it. Sin carries its own condemnation with it: Sometimes the particular effects of ſin do half perſwade us to be Chriſtians, to leave the ſervice of ſin; a ſtroke or two upon the Conſcience, do thus far prevail, as to pauſe and ſtop; <q>If then we knew ſin in the latitude of its bitter effects, and in the intenſiveneſs of them (beyond all thoughts) for bitterneſs and perpetuity, as alſo that extreme vileneſs in the formal nature of it, which is the vaſt womb and Ocean, out of which theſe bitter waters do flow; if we did know ſin as the darkeſt blot, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome blur, oppoſite to the trueſt Glory of pureſt Holineſs; and as the moſt deformed and higheſt Rebellion to the moſt equal Laws and Rules of Divine Soveraignty; and as the very Eclipſe, and utter Inconſiſtence with all real Happineſs; and as the infallible and unavoidable Precipice of our intollerable and eternal Damnation:</q> At leaſt, this would be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional excitation, if not a ſtrong foundation, upon which to raiſe a Reſolution to quit and forſake it.

Our excellencies are weak, and the Lord be merciful unto us, how often do we weaken them? our work is but little that we do, very little; take aſide the averſneſs, the indiſpoſitions, the formalities, the coldneſs, the diſtractions, the unbelief, the wearineſs, the inconſtancy, the infinite infirmities which accompany them, what poor things will they then appear? may we not fall down and ſay, having done our beſt, We are

Nay, and that which being known may likewiſe abaſe us, is this, we may juſtly ſay of all our poor excellencies, as the Widow of her Veſſels, They are but borrowed ware; What have we which we have not received? Every Gift and Grace which we have, is but a Beam born of the Sun, a drop coming from another Fountain then our Natures: all our good is but free Gift; take the borrowed feathers from the Crow, it is then a moſt black creature alone.

Though you may be free from many other actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and groſs exorbitancies, if yet the ſpirit of pride (be it in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, or Naturals, or Civils, or Morals) dwell within you, and rule over you, it may be ſaid of you what the Prophet ſpake of the ſtout-hearted, <hi>They were far from righteouſneſs.</hi>

This is a moſt ordinary truth, that they who are ſo prying after the faults of others, ſeldom ſearch themſelvs, and hereby onely enable their own pride, but diſable themſelvs for humbleneſs. It is not forreign, but experimental knowledge which makes us lowly. But you may reply, How may it bee known that our hearts are not lofty, but lowly, that ſo we may <note place="margin">How it may be known that our hearts are not lofty, but low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> judge our repentance not to be be formal, but ſound. <hi>Sol.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a word or two and then I have done, that I ſpeak onely of <hi>Lowlineſs,</hi> as it is to be found in Chriſtians <hi>in this life,</hi> which is not a ſtate of perfection, but imperfection. Secondly, as it <hi>in conflict and combate,</hi> not as abſolute and free. Now then 1. <hi>If you be truly lowly, then you live altogether upon free and meer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">You then live upon meer mercy.</note> Every mercy is an alms unto you, and is ſued out not upon deſert, but upon promiſe: you can find no mony to buy corn, but all muſt be free gift: you will be content to buy without mony, and to receive without price. 2. <hi>You will then be more patient under delays:</hi> it is but a proud beggar who will be ſerved at firſt knock, or elſe will be gone. It is a very ill ſign when we are ſo <note place="margin">You will be patient under delayes.</note> quick with God, that he ſhall loſe our ſervice if he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſend out his anſwers. Were we indeed ſenſible of our own unworthineſs, we would hold it no diſparagement to wait at heaven gates; he will patiently wait for ſome mercy, who humbly knows that he deſervs none. Even an humble heart may urge God to make haſte, but it is our proud heart which accuſeth and quarrels with him for delay. 3. <hi>You will be ſilent in denials and withdrawments.</hi> Doth not God anſwer me? Why! I deſerv no look nor anſwer. Doth he <note place="margin">You will be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in denials.</note> not give what I ask, but take away what he hath given? Why it is the Lord, let him do with his own what he pleaſeth. It is mercy that I have yet any mercy: I am unworthy to enjoy any good, who am moſt worthy to enjoy all evil. When we are our ſelves, this will be our temper, if we be humble, God ſhall uſe his own authority and pleaſure to diſpoſe of the mercies which we crave, and of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115664:68"/> mercies alſo which we have; we will be more patient in denials, and ſilent in loſſes; What can we ſay who are unworthy of all? 4. <hi>You will be very thankful for any anſwer, or the leaſt mercy.</hi> If nothing will content us but great mercies, aſſuredly we are not <note place="margin">You will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thankful for the leaſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> humble, but have too great ſpirits. He who indeed judgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies and truth which God ſhews unto him, will take up a great miſery with quietneſs, and a little mercy with thankfulneſs. The body of man if it bee ſound, can ſtoop for a pin, as well as for a piece; and the heart, if it be humble, can bleſs for little mercies, as well as for great. The touch of the little finger, as well as of the great, will make a well-tuned ſtringed inſtrument ſpeak, and even the whiſperings of the voice are ecchoed back in an exact concave. The leaſt drops of mercy affect the lowly heart, which can awake upon the leaſt noiſe. The proud heart like the mountain yields a poor crop after a ſhower of mercies, but the humble heart, like the Gardens, yields plenty of ſweet ſmelling ſacrifices, after the leaſt dews or drops of merciful bleſſings and anſwers from God. Now ſay, How do you plead with God when you approach unto him? what can you ſhew for the mercies that you ask? onely his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, no worth in you to move him: And how are you when God delaies, or denies, or removes his mercies? can you then be in duſt and aſhes, and not in fire and flames? can you yet quietly ſerve him, wait on him, depend on him, ſubmit to him upon this ground? Ah! I am a ſinner; I have wronged the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; abuſed all his mercies; am not worthy of the leaſt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: It is mercy that ever I had mercy, that now I have any, that which is loſt and denied, I am not worthy of them; that which I have, I am not worthy of. And when God anſwers you either in ſpirituals, to your ſouls; or in temporals, to your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, How do you look upon his anſwers? Do you look a ſquint on them as he upon <hi>Solomons</hi> Cities? Are you able to abuſe great mercies, and ſlight the leaſt? 5.

As Gods liberality appears in giving many times before we ask, and ſometimes in giving more then we ask, and ſometimes in giving a better thing then we ask; ſo his graciouſneſs appears in not conſidering how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy we are, what Cauſes and Arguments we can bring, but in a a free diſpenſation of his mercies to us, without all deſert or

For indeed the true ſenſe of our unworthineſs, is a ſpecial part of our ſpiritual poverty, and poverty of ſpirit breeds the ſtrongeſt deſires, even hungring and thirſting after

And thus briefly for the Explication and Comfirmation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Now I proceed to the uſeful Application of it:</p>
               <p>The Uſes which I will make of this point ſhall be. 1. To try our ſelves whether we be ſenſible of our unworthineſs in our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> Addreſſes unto God. 2. Then to encourage our hearts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our unworthineſs to draw near to the Throne of Grace. 1. <hi>For Examination.</hi> Are we ſenſible of our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in our approaches unto God? that we deſerve nothing at <note place="margin">For Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> all? that we come not to buy, but to beg? not to deſerve, but to receive? There be many reaſons why I put you upon this <note place="margin">Reaſons of our Trial.</note> ſearch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe many pervert this Doctrine of perſonal unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs:</hi> they utterly miſtake it; they do profeſs that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Many pervert the Doctrine of perſonal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</note> that is in them can deſerve any thing with God, and therefore trample upon all holineſs of heart, and godlineſs of life, as if there were no uſe of Grace but to merit; or Gold were of no uſe but in a Crown. But theſe are a loathſome people, who would link great mercies and a wicked life together: To be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our unworthineſs is not to reſt in an evil condition, nor is it to run on in an evil converſation, nor is it to ſlight holy duties for thy performances, nor is it to diſregard habitual or actual Grace: this argues an unſenſible and ſeared conſcience: But this it is, to ſtrive againſt ſin, to ſtrive after all holineſs, to be careful and watchful to pious performances, yet with all, and after all, to caſt thoſe Crowns to the ground, not in their names, but in the name of Chriſt, and free mercy to expect anſwer and help. Though imperfect holineſs in the habits or acts cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie men, yet they may glorifie God; and though they put not dignity into the hand, yet they put a capacity into the hand; a fitneſs to receive, though not a worthineſs to claim.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>many tender Chriſtians are not yet rightly ſenſible of their unworthineſs;</hi> they are very apt to inſiſt and adhear unto <note place="margin">Many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115664:73"/> will love freely, and pardon ſin for his own ſake, yet they are not contented to accept, to receive; they are moſt hardly perſwaded that the Sun will ſhine ſo freely, that God will accept ſuch a vile ſinner upon ſuch eaſie terms, and without any more adoe paſs by all tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>Another is, that <hi>they are frequent in digging after reaſons and cauſes of good in themſelves;</hi> If they could bring Hearts more broken, Graces more ſtrong, Affections more melting, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations leſs tainted; then they could be perſwaded that God would hear and grant them the mercy or good which they do deſire: I confeſs that we muſt ſtrive after perfection in all Grace; enlarged deſires, an humble complaint, a fervent endeavour in the uſe of all ſacred means; all of theſe are commendable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet herein we fail, and exceedingly to, if we pluck back the hand from receiving, becauſe we are not full; that we will not ſuck the breſts, becauſe we are empty; that we would find any cauſes of good in our ſelves, who at our beſt are unprofitable and unworthy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe it is a very dangerous thing to ſtand upon our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſtand upon perſonal worthineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>worthineſs, when we approach unto the Lord;</hi> For, <hi>Now we come without Chriſt, we do ſacrifice alone,</hi> we take the Office of our <hi>high Prieſt</hi> out of his hands; Nay, <hi>we fruſtrate the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt,</hi> for we cannot joyn our worthineſs and his toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if we plead in our own names, we make void his: As it is in the point of Juſtification, if we ſtand to our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, we make void the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: So is it in the matter of ſupplication, if we ſtand to our own worthineſs, and will be heard for our own ſake, we exclude the merit of Chriſts interceſſion; we may as well be our own redeemers, as our own interceſſours: <hi>We meet with pure justice;</hi> for if we ſtand upon perſonal dignity, then our qualities and actions muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have equality to juſtice; God muſt diſpence to us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our own deſerts; when we ſtand upon our own worthineſs, then God deals with us in juſtice; if we renounce it, then room is made for the mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then you will demand, how may we know, that <note place="margin">How we may know that we are truly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</note> we are rightly ſenſible of our unworthineſs, in our approaches unto God?</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all the parts of Repentance; and for quickneſs, Now, turn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the better opening of this Aſſertion, premiſe with me a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the execution of a penitential reſolution, is nothing <note place="margin">This is meant of the very pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> elſe but <hi>an acting courſe, or the very practiſe of Repentance.</hi> When not onely the Judgement approves of the parts and rules of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the Will embraceth them with conſent and deſire, but the Endeavour alſo doth, as it were, copy them forth in the Converſation. <hi>I exerciſe my ſelf to have a good conſcience,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle: So when the ſinner doth exerciſe Repentance, when he doth hate ſin indeed, and flies from it, and forſakes it indeed; and when he doth indeed walk in the ways of new obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115664:75"/> a very ſervant of righteouſneſs, and works the work of God, this is the execution, or the performance of a penitential pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution. As walking is to a journey, or as writing is to a copy, or as fighting is to a war, that is penitential execution to penitential reſolution. It is but the Theory (as it were) drawn down and put forth; It is as the tree ſhooting out into bloſſoms and fruits: It is repentance in life, which is the life of repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That preſentneſs of Execution is <hi>an undelayed acting.</hi> Our actions fall vvithin three ſpaces of time; either of the vvhich is <note place="margin">And of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delayed acting.</note> paſt (as vvhat vve have done;) or of that vvhich is future (as that vvhich ſhall be done;) or of that vvhich is preſent (as that vvhich is doing.) Look as true Marriage, it is not a future, but a preſent acceptation: So true Repentance is not a delayed, but a preſent reformation. Or as in Writing, the motion of the Pen and the forming of the Letter are ſimultaneous: Or as in a Clock, the vvheel doth move and the finger doth move: So in the buſineſs of Repentance; the purpoſe of amendment, ſhould at the ſame time drop out into the change of heart and vvays. To have repentance onely in our purpoſes, is onely to have water in a cloud, or phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in a glaſs, it is not yet to do it. Reſolutions may be for the future, but Executions are for the preſent act; an hearing while it is to day, and not hardning of the heart. As St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being called, vvent immediately up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo preſent executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repentance is, vvhen we do not defer the penitential work; a not allowing of our ſelves in giving vvay to our ſins, no, not an hour, as the Apoſtle ſpake in another caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is a two-fold preſent execution of penitential purpoſes: One is <hi>immediate;</hi> or vvhen the purpoſe and the acting <note place="margin">And of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent execution, either for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediateneſs, or ſeaſonableneſs.</note> (vvithout diſtance of time) ſucceed one the other, there being no predominant impediment to the inſtantaneous execution of that penitential purpoſe. Another is <hi>ſeaſonable;</hi> vvhere, though twixt the purpoſe and the acting there may be ſome diſtance of time, yet the apprehenſion of the next occaſion may truly make the execution or practiſe to be preſent. As in the caſe of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential reſtitution, it may ſo fall out, either through the inability of the eſtate, or the ſubjection of the perſon, that he cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſtore; yet becauſe the penitent perſon in ſuch a caſe layes hold on the next opportunity and occaſion, his reſolution may be ſaid to be acted preſently, <hi>(i.)</hi> upon the next preſent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115664:76"/> time when God enables h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m to act his purpoſe of reſtoring: So that penitential Reſolution produceth preſent Execution; either for immediateneſs, as in moſt caſes; or for ſeaſonableneſs, as in ſome caſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is again a double penitential Execution of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential <note place="margin">And in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> Reſolution: One conſiſts in <hi>endeavour</hi> and <hi>application;</hi> when the perſon, without delays, addreſſeth or applieth himſelf to the ways by which ſins may be ſubdued and forſaken: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiſts in <hi>victory</hi> and <hi>aſſecution,</hi> wherein the Penitent doth in ſome more eminent degree lead captivity captive. That peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Execution whereof I ſpeak, properly and naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the former. though it muſt aim and ſtrive after the latter alſo; <hi>(i.)</hi> when a perſon doth indeed reſolve to leave his ſins, and to ſerve the Lord in newneſs of life; this Reſolution doth actively excite him to be much in Prayer unto the Lord, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to hearken to, and obſerve his Word, and to decline the occaſions which may give ſtrength to his corruptions: It cauſeth him to reſiſt evil motions, and to bewail them; it ſets him upon all ſorts of Duties and Ordinances, ſo that the perſon is now real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working againſt ſin, and throughly working for God; he is in the ways of God, and according to the meaſure of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, working the works of God.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould penitential Intentions be accompanied with preſent Executions or performances?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Reaſons for it are many. 1. <hi>That God who commands</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to repent preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
                  <hi>us to repent, commands us preſently to repent.</hi> The Time is under Precept, as well as the Work. Some Precepts bind us <hi>ſemper,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> other Precepts bind us <hi>ſemper</hi> &amp; <hi>ad ſemper</hi> too: When the Lord commands any man to repent, this is a Duty which concerns the whole courſe of his life; it takes hold of him as ſoon as ever he lives, and is become a ſinner; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him, not onely in his latter days, but all his days.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It is very dangerous to defer our penitential Executions</hi> or actings: Whether we conſider, 1. <hi>The Reſolutions themſelves;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is dangerous to delay.</note> they are but accidental, and not natural things; not ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (or rather motions) which ariſe from an in-bred principle, but are forenſical to our natures, and being not preſently cheriſhed by acting, like little ſparks of fire, may eaſily vaniſh, languiſh, and extinguiſh. We read of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115664:76"/> people in Covenant, and like <hi>a deceitfull Bow.</hi> Naked Reſolutions will never ripen and abide; if you will not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your Reſolutions, you will quickly fall from your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 2. <hi>Our own hearts, ah! how deceitfull are they!</hi> how full of rebellion! how averſe to all good! Like the cold hearth to a little fire; how cunning to keep up Sin in the Throne! how willing to break aſunder all the bands of Obedience! with much adoe reſolving, with little adoe diſſolving thoſe reſolves again. <hi>Volebam</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin) &amp; nolebam;</hi> I would, and yet I would not; one while I would, and by and by I wouldnot. It is the Genius of cur ſinfull hearts, to apprehend the preſent time for ſin, and to crave the future time for repentance: Our worſt work we would do inſtantly, our beſt work we would do negligently: Good motions are like a Bird falling into our hands, which if we preſently catch not, ſhe inſtantly flees away. Gracious purpoſes in our hearts, are like warmth in the water; the impreſſion requires ſome degrees, and ſome blowing; but the receſſion is eaſie; the natural coldneſs in the water will inſtantly riſe up and expel that heat: if you be not watchfull, <hi>&amp;c. 3. Extinguiſhing occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Repentance, in all the parts of it, hath many enemies and hinderances, ſome within us, ſome without us: the Reſolutions are weak, but the Occaſions are ſtrong. Let the ſhip alone, and if the Pilot hath onely a reſolution to ſail with, the next tide, or the next wind may carry the ſhip away. How ordinary is the experience, That the ſtrength of occaſions have beaten back, and put to flight many and many a reſolution? like a croſs wind, which hath carried back the ſhip unto the very harbour whence it came forth. Meer reſolutions are but unarmed Souldiers, or as unwalled Cities. You ſhall find much of this truth, That meet reſolutions are too weak for proper and ſudden occaſions. 4. <hi>Or the aſſiſtance of Grace</hi> To reſolve, and not to act, is one way whereby we quench the Spirit. The Spirit, you know, may be quenched many ways: <hi>Poſitively,</hi> as when we will walk in paths expreſly contrary to his motions; this is to throw water upon the fire: <hi>Negatively,</hi> when we do not follow nor cheriſh his motions; as you quench the fire, if you do not ſtir it, or blow it, or add more unto it. So when the Spirit of God ſhall deal thus far with us, as to convince us that our courſe is evil, and yet further, to excite a purpoſe in our hearts to deſiſt; but then we let the work
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115664:77"/> lie ſtill, we do not ſt againſt that evil way, this may cauſe the Spirit of God to withdraw, to deſert the ſinner who doth deſert his counſel; who will be a Counſell our to him, who will walk in no counſel but his own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Penitential Executions, if preſent, will be more eaſie, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Preſent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be More eaſie.</note> 
                  <hi>more comfortable. 1. They will be more eaſie.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had almoſt waſted his ſpirits with reſolutions and conflicts; <hi>Quamdiu, cras, cras, &amp;c.</hi> and he thought it many times im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him ever to be rid of ſuch an inmate as ſin: But when his reſolution brake out into practiſe, then <hi>Facile &amp; ſuave,</hi> the work grew eaſie and ſweet. When we come to the acting part, then the Lord will exert and put forth his power in our weakneſs: the acting and doing Chriſtian partakes of moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Do we not find it thus in Prayer, and in many other Duties, which perhaps we look upon with much fear and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But when we are acting of them, how ſingularly doth the Lord enlarge our thoughts and affections? Why! this holds in the very Duty of Repentance; ſeta againſt thy ſins in good earneſt, ſet upon a holy courſe in good earneſt, thou ſhalt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permentally find, that it was thy owne deceitfull heart which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the work with more difficulty; but now having taken upon thee the yoke of Chriſt, thou ſhalt find it eaſie, and that God can as well work in thee to do, as to will. 2. They <note place="margin">More Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> will <hi>be more comfortable.</hi> Meer purpoſes cannot ſpring up ſuch comforts as actings; nay, even weak actings yield a thouſand times more comfort than ſtrong reſolutions: All the ſap in the root doth not make the flower to ſmell ſweet, unleſs that ſap comes to a bloſſome. We cannot ſay our reſolutions are ſolid, if unactive. If they do not alter the courſe, for ought as we know yet, they may be but falſe flaſhes, occaſional impreſſions, not ſpringing from renewing Grace, (which will break out into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,) but from ſervile cauſes, which may be ſufficient to ſtop a ſinner, and with <hi>Saul,</hi> to profeſs he will perſecute <hi>David</hi> no more: But when Execution attends Reſolution, now the heart may be confident, that there is a renewing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple implanted, which carries the ſoul from one degree to another; from convictions to reſolutions, from reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to actions, from actions to courſes with ſtedfaſtneſs and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">

The <hi>Motives.</hi> 2. The <hi>Means</hi> for a preſent Execution. 1. The <hi>Motives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A preſent Execution is the trueſt part of Repentance:</hi> At the <note place="margin">Motives. A preſent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is the trueſt part of Repentance.</note> beſt, you are but in a preparation, in a meer diſpoſition towards Repentance, until you act it; it is not ſo much what you would be, as what you are; what you intend, as what you practiſe, that will give the moſt real teſtimony of your Repentance. 2. <hi>A preſent execution, it is the ſafeſt part of repentance:</hi> Of the two, he is in the more ſure condition, who reſolves to leave a wicked <note place="margin">And the ſafeſt part of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> life, and doth indeed forſake it; and reſolves to lead a holy life, and doth indeed enterprize it; than he who reſolves on both, but practiſeth neither. The doer of good is a thouſand times more ſure then the reſolver: ſomething in ſome caſes may be ſaid to ſtay a perſon from his reſolutions; yet if nothing comes of the reſolutions, I aſſure you the ſcales will hang trembling: but action doth more fully determine the eſtate, and the Scripture is more clear for the ſpiritual eſtate, as it lies in practiſe, then as it lies in purpoſe. 3. <hi>A preſent execution, it is the comfortableſt part;</hi> While repentance lies only in reſolution, it is but as a Tree in <note place="margin">And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableſt part of Repentance.</note> the Winter, perhaps well rooted, but it lives dry; but when repentance breaks out into action, it is as a Tree in the Spring, well rooted, well flowered, and well ſmelling too. There is more comfort to do, then to intend to do; indeed to ceaſe a ſinful courſe, and indeed to walk an holy life, this opens all the comforts of of the promiſes, draws down the favour of God, aſſures us more of intereſt in Chriſt, excuſeth more in the conſcience, reviveth more in all occurrences. 4. <hi>A preſent execution, it is the wiſeſt part;</hi> we cannot ſay what we ſhall do to morrow, when we cannot aſſure <note place="margin">And the wiſeſt part.</note> our ſelves, what, and where we ſhall be to morrow: He is wiſeſt for Divine Glory, and for his own happineſs, who acts an immediate duty of ſalvation, upon preſent terms. There are four things which declare wiſdome; One to ſow in ſeaſon; Another, to ſail in ſeaſon; A third, to accept and receive the Word of Grace in ſeaſon; A fourth to act repentance in ſeaſon, even now while it is called to day.</p>
               <p n="2">

               <p>1. The impediments of a preſent execution are many. <note place="margin">Take heed of the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cillity of Reſolution.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Imbecility of reſolution: Debile fundamentum fallit opus;</hi> if the foundation be weak, how can the building be ſtrong? the houſe which was built on a Rock, did ſtand; but that which was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the Sands, fell down: Where reſolutions are either weakly raiſed on ſtrong grounds, or ſuddenly raiſed on weak and mutable occaſions, there is either no execution, or uncertain; for no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doth exceed the virtue of his cauſe: <hi>Thou haſt almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to be a Chriſtian;</hi> this left King <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſtill in Heatheniſme. You will never go through with the work, if you attain not to a thorow reſolution; when you have an heart that goes and comes, you will have only fits of repentance, which will come and go: Of two things be ſure, if ever you would penitentially act to purpoſe; One that you ſee ſtrong and prevalent reaſons to change your courſe of life, ſuch as may not be over topped by any arguments that ſin may ſuggeſt hereafter; they are the ſpirits in the brain, which confer to motion in the Hands and Legs: Another, that you reſolve not on deceitful and fallible grounds. If your reſolutions be upon Motives, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutable, or conditional; you may be troubled with much temptation, but you will never advance in much penitential actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Servile fear:</hi> When we ſo exalt the opinions of men, and their Tongues, and their Power; what will they think of me? <note place="margin">Servile fear.</note> how will they nick-name, and diſgrace me? what may befall me? who can tell what miſchief they may do unto me? Theſe are the Froſts which nip the buds, and the Winds which bind the Ship, and the Remora's which hold the Children ſtill in the birth. We love the opinions of men, to be well thought on; and the Tongues of men to be well ſpoken of; and the reſpects of men to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, and encouraged: A croſs way makes us ſtart; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> would not obey the Lord, leaſt the Princes ſhould laugh at him; and many of the Jews durſt not confeſs Chriſt, for fear of the Scribes and Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore if you would deſcend into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent execution of penitential purpoſes, you muſt not be ſlaviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected unto man; you muſt not fear the power of man, nor be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Deſpair of performance:</hi> Why, ſay we, as good never a <note place="margin">Diſpair of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</note> whit as never the better. It is not poſſible that ever we ſhould get hands to conquer all theſe ſins, or feet to walk in all theſe wayes which are ſo holy, ſo many, ſo ſtrict, ſo difficult. We cannot find words to pray, nay, God knows, ſometimes not hearts; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin are thick and ſtrong, and ableevery moment to lead us captive; we have made ſome aſſay, but alas, the work proves ſo harſh, ſo uncomfortable, ſo unproſperous; we are without all ſtrength, we ſhall never break all theſe bonds of ſin, nor tread through all theſe pathes of holy duties. Thus as death cloſeth up our eyes, ſo doth deſpair ſhut up all our actions; where there is no hope to finiſh, there will be no heart to begin: But let us reject ſuch deſpairing deluſions; what hath been done may be done; what God commands to do, he can enable to do; and what he promiſeth that we ſhall do, that he will make and cauſe us do: But God hath commanded us to leave all our ſinful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to lead a life of holineſs; God hath promiſed grace
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115664:80"/> ſufficient to forſake an evill way and to walk in a good way, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and you ſhall keep my judgments and do them,</hi> Ezek. 36. 27. If God gives ſtrength to work, why ſhould we with-hold hearts to work? <hi>Da Domine quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis,</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin:</hi> Lord, give what thou commandeſt, and then command what thou wilt. Seriouſly conſider any one penitential work, for which God hath not promiſed grace and ſtrength to perform. Many have travelled in this penitential Work, and have found it very feiſable and paſſable: How many are this day in heaven? and how many are walking towards heaven? all of them prove, that it is not impoſſible to execute penitential reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hypocriſie and guile of heart:</hi> Where the heart is falſe, <note place="margin">Hypocriſie.</note> there the performance is faint; if the work be not done in the heart, it will never be done in the life; the work is beſt done in the life, which is firſt done in the heart. They in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had rotten hearts, they did not cordially intend to leave their own wayes, and therefore when they were put to it indeed, they would not yield to walk in the wayes which God preſcribed. Where an holy way is not throughly approved, and where an evil way is not throughly hated, there may be many flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but there will never be ſolid performances or courſes: <hi>Yet a little ſleep, yet a little ſlumber, yet a little folding of the hands,</hi> ſaid the Sluggard, who loved ſleep and idleneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. So where our affections are hank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore if you vvould execute your penitential reſolutions, take heed of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections; if they again prevail upon you, they vvill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly intangle and hinder you, they mar the judgment, and cloſe vvith temptations, and hinder actions. Oh how ſuddenly vvill they quench your ſpirits, alter your judgments, put aſide your duties, extenuate your purpoſes, bring you into further bondage, confirm your unwillingneſs, excite your fears, raiſe up diſcouragements, and all to fruſtrate the preſent executions
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115664:81"/> of your former reſolutions. Corrupt affections are the very gates of ſin, the Bane of holineſs, the Quenchers of reſolutions, and the Impediments of all good performances.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Worldly cares:</hi> Our Saviout ſaith, <hi>That the ſeed which fell among thornes was chaoked,</hi> Luke 8. 7. And what was it which <note place="margin">Worldly cares.</note> did choa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The cares, and riches, and pleaſures of this Life,</hi> There are two things which worldly cares do choak <hi>viz.</hi> Heavenly directions of the word, and Heavenly reſolutions of the heart; ſo that neither the one nor the other do come unto perfection, Holy performance or action, it is the end or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all knowledg and reſolution, and worldly cares ſtifle both. You have many a man who comes to the word, and hears the terrours of God and his wrath revealed againſt his unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ounſneſs, inſomuch that his ſoul (with <hi>Felix)</hi> trembles under the ſtrokes of divine juſtice; Or he hears how happy and bleſſed the condition and life of holineſs is; what heavens of mercies, what rivers of comforts, what excuſations and peace of Conſcience, what bleſſings in life, what ſupports in death, what rewards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death it ſhall procure to perſons; upon the one and the other he is ſtirred up to the ſenſe of his ſins, to the admiration of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; to a condemnation of his evil courſe, to a reſolution for a better. But then it is with him as with ſome ſhip, ſometimes as ſoon as it is putting out of the Harbor, it ſtrikes upon a rock, or falls into the ſands, and loſeth all the precious lading: Or as with Corn ſown and let fall in an open and ſolid place, where the Birds come down and inſtantly pick it up; ſo is it here with this man, the world meets him again at the Church door, or at his own door, and all theſe impreſſions and reſolutions are ſpilt and gone; Worldly engagements take preſent poſſeſſion of his thoughts, and all the ſervice of his affections, ſo that he hath no time to conſider what God did ſpeak or work in him; no time ſecretly to beg of God to write thoſe truths in his heart, to keep all this in the purpoſe of his heart, to give him the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace and ſtrength to walk in the wayes of God revealed now unto him. When you turn the courſe of the water another way, the Mill cannot ſtir; ſo when men turn the courſe of their thoughts and affections to ſecular and vain imployments, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions ſtand ſtill, they have nothing now to elicit or draw them on and out into any holy or careful diligence of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Or of <hi>Future ability:</hi> This is a work which we will do at pleaſure and at leiſure: when we ſee the ſcouts, the forerunners of the army, then we will buckle on our armor: when we eſpy the harbingers of death approaching, old age, ſickneſs, weakneſs, diſeaſes, then we will think of heaven, and forſake hell: what need we be troubling our ſelves to be doing of that a long time, which we can diſpatch at any time? if we have but time to ſay, Lord have mercy upon me, what would ye more? Or of <hi>Future Mercy:</hi> Wherefore hath God Mercy but for ſinners? and he hath ſaid, That if at any time a ſinner convert he will have mercy: We have found him kind unto us all our dayes, and doubt not of his fatherly compaſſion at the laſt.

And as for thy future ability, why doſt thou ſo groſly befool thy ſelf? knoweſt thou not that preſent Neglects cauſe stronger Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions? <hi>Qui non eſt hodie, cras minus aptus erit,</hi> the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy will teach thee. Every man by more ſinning grows more ſinful, and therefore moſt unapt and averſe to good. And then <hi>Future Mercy,</hi> it is of all things the moſt uncertain to pardon ſin, where preſent mercy leaves us not to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from ſin: it is all one as if thou ſhouldſt thus argue, God will hereafter pardon me, and therefore for the preſent I will ſin againſt him, diſobey, diſhonour, vex, and grieve, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe him. Theſe are the principal impediments to a preſent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115664:82"/> expectation of penitential reſolutions, and are to be declined by us. I now proceed to the <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>furtherances to a preſent</hi>

                     </gap> reſolutions,</hi> which are theſe, amongſt many.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Solid Conviction of a ſinful eſtate:</hi> This will put us upon a preſent Execution. When the Soul is brought to an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <note place="margin">Solid convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate.</note> ſenſe of the vileneſs and bitterneſs of ſin, it will not then lye hovering; Were I beſt to give up this courſe, or ſhall I go on in it ſtill? No, but when the Soul is indeed wounded, the wayes ſhall without delay be reformed; take a perſon in ſome judicial, and cloſe conviction of ſin, upon a ſick and dying bed, how forward is a perſon then to change and better his courſes; much more do ſolid and evangelical convictions ſweetly diſpoſe, and incline the heart to the forſaking of an evil, and walking in a good way. They in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. were pricked in their hearts, and what did this work in them? they cry out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> So <hi>Saul</hi> was ſtruck to the ground, and was aſtoniſhed, and trembled, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cries out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Act.</hi> 9. 4, 6. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions you ſee many times do put on men to alter and reform their wayes; of much greater force are inward afflictions of ſpirit. Go on yet in ſin! God forbid! ſhall I continue in ſin any longer, who, if I make not haſte, may loſe all mercy, and drop into Hell it ſelf? what I feel is much, what I deſerve, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Holy Wiſdome:</hi> To know times and ſeaſons, is an high <note place="margin">Holy wiſdome.</note> part of Wiſdome; <hi>Walk not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15, 16. There are four things which ſolid Wiſdome teacheth a man; One is, to look to the beſt part; Another, to make choice of the beſt good; A third, to walk in the beſt wayes; A fourth is to do all this in the firſt place, and ſureſt time: Have I any thing more near to me, then my ſoul? more concerning my ſoul then God? more concerning God, then walking before him? Where am I, if I loſe my Soul? what am I, if I enjoy not God? whether run I, if I continue in ſin? if my ſoul be neareſt, and God choiceſt, and his wayes ſafeſt, why do I demur? what, ſhould I take time, or put off the doing of that which is ever beſt done, when it is done? If I will live yet in ſin, for ought I know, I may then dye in ſin; and if I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115664:82"/> dye in ſin, I muſt for ever periſh for ſin; Why ſhould I not? Do I not admit the preſent loſs of that, which elſe may be the eternal loſs of my Soul? But if I ſet into an holy life, this is the very path of God, the image of Glory, the Ark of ſafety, and the pledg of an happy eternity. Why ſhould I be ſo ſafety, and the pledg of an happy eternity. Why ſhould I be ſo fooliſh, to be miſerably bad, who in a moment may be aſſuredly bleſſed? any wiſdome will teach me to leave a wicked life, for an holy and good; which hath made me to know, that mercy is beter then miſery; and that Heaven is better then Hell.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Chriſtian Courage:</hi> If we will not act the wayes of Heaven, till we ſee all difficulties removed, and all dangers <note place="margin">Chriſtian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> ſecured, we ſhall never enter into thoſe wayes: but when the love of Chriſt hath inflamed our hearts with a right zeal of his Glory, aſſuredly, we will be ding: <hi>Modo magnificetur Chriſtus,</hi> I muſt bring ſome Glory to my God, <hi>&amp;c. Luther</hi> feared not to go to the Diet at <hi>Worms,</hi> had there been as many divels, as tiles on the houſes: What do you tell S. <hi>Paul</hi> of bonds, or ſpeak to the couragious Chriſtian of diſcouragements; <hi>I have ſworn, and will perform it</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>that I will keep thy righteous ſtatutes.</hi> S. <hi>Jerom</hi> would not only renounce, but throw off, and trample upon father and mother for Chriſt: What do you ſpeak of poverty, of diſgraces, of loſſes, of want, of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denials in eaſe, in pleaſures? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He who will be good, can loſe nothing but that which will loſe him; and get that which he ſhould never have gotten, had he not been good indeed.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A precious eſtimation and affection after Gods honour:</hi> Ah! <note place="margin">A precious eſtimation of Gods honour.</note> did we in any holy meaſure comprehend the height, and bredth, and depth of his favour in Chriſt; would we not ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate? ſhould not the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffer violence? What to ſand upon a ſinful pleaſure, or profit, or way, and to loſe a good, gracious, bountiful God: What ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſt, pleaſure, way would we ſtand upon? What holy courſe or way would we ſet upon? would we be ſlow to ſee the face of God, and live? would we not ſpeedily ſet our ſelves in the wayes of his countenance? <hi>Zacheus</hi> being deſirous to <hi>ſee Chriſt,</hi> upon his call, <hi>made haſte and came down.</hi> Luke 19. 6.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:115664:83"/>
               <p>5. <hi>A tender fear of God:</hi> This alſo cauſeth a preſent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our purpoſes. You read what it wrought in <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> in others. When the heart apprehends its way to be evil, and the diſpleaſure of God to hang over it, and his threatnings all in armour, &amp;c. Oh, I dare not go on to offend any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger!</p>
               <p>6. <hi>A right belief in God:</hi> Whether you take it in the <hi>threats,</hi> as they of <hi>Niniveh</hi> believed the preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> and <note place="margin">A tender fear of God.</note> preſently humbled and reformed themſelves and wayes, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Promiſes</hi> of ſweeteſt mercy made unto real penitents, that full, free, ſoon mercy ſhall be had: Why? if thoſe be believed, they will draw off the ſoul from a ſinful courſe <note place="margin">A right Belief in God.</note> unto a good courſe. The Apoſtle therefore <hi>beſeecheth</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>by the mercies of God to be transformed,</hi> Rom. 12. 1. O this, that God offers and aſſures me of mercy, and now I may have it if I will now reform, a puts the ſoul to the preſent work; To day I will hear his voice, for to day is the day of mercy, this is an acceptable ſeaſon, now I may be made happy for ever.</p>

               <p>Theſe words contein in them two parts,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The real practice of Repentance;</hi> which conſiſts not in a bare Reſolution, but in a ſincere Execution <hi>(I will ariſe,</hi> ſaid the Prodigal) this was <hi>Motus volentis;</hi> (and he did ariſe,) this was <hi>opus penitentis.

               </p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115664:83"/> look on themſelves with abomination, but God looks on them with compaſſion: he looks on the penitent ſinner with a pitiful affection: When <hi>Ephraim</hi> repented, and turned, <hi>My Bowels</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him:</hi> As ſoon as ever the Prodigal looks back, mercy looks out. <hi>q. d.</hi> Ah! is he returned indeed?

               <p n="1">1. One of <hi>ſpeedy readineſs: [The Father ran]</hi> The Son doth go, the Father ran. Mercy hath not only a quick eye, but foot alſo; it poſts, it ſpeeds, it runs to embrace a penitent: God is very ſlow to puniſh a ſinner, but he is very ready to relieve and accept of a returning ſinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond, Of <hi>wonderful tenderneſs: [The Father fell on his neck]</hi> To have looked on him, was it not enough? to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order for his uſage, had it not been well? to have taken him by the hand, had it not been too much? but the Father did more then all this <hi>[He fell on his neck.]</hi> Divine mercy will not only meet a penitent, but embrace him. That ſinner whom the hands of juſtice would have everlaſtingly confounded, if he be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the arms of mercy will lovingly claſp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third, Of <hi>ſtrong affectionateneſs: [And kiſſed him]</hi> Here are eyes to behold the returning Son, and an heart to pity him, and feet to meet him, and armes to embrace him, and lips alſo to kiſs him: Naked mercies are not enough (in Gods account) for a true penitent, he muſt have ſealed mercies too. God doth not think it enough that he is reconciled unto hm, unleſs alſo he doth teſtifie and make it known that he is ſo.</p>

               <p>That <hi>the very Initials of true Repentance are ſeen by God:</hi>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The very Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of true Repentance are ſeen by God.</note> The penitent Prodigal was in the way, but yet it was a great way off; and his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my trangreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 32. 5. <hi>Vox n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ndum in ora erat &amp; Auris Dei in corda erat,</hi> So. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in Locum. Iſai. 66. 2. <hi>To this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembles at my word.</hi> Repentance may be conſidered in three degrees, 1. In the <hi>Impreſſion of it:</hi> ANd this is when ſo much grace
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115664:84"/> is implanted, as to turn the heart. 2. <hi>In the expreſſion of it:</hi> and this is, when ſo much Grace appears, as to enter into a new path, and do new works. 3. <hi>In the progreſſion of it:</hi> And this is, when a greater Victory is obtained over our ſins, and appears in our courſe of new obedience. Now the Initials of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I conjecture, to conſiſts partly in the Converſion of the heart; when the mind, and will, and affections are healed, and turned: and partly, in the reformation of the life; when the perſon out of an hatred of ſin, and love of God, ſets upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe of obedience, and ſervice. It is juſt like a Ship, that is going out, or like a Shop that is newly ſet up; things are very raw, there is much droſs with the little Silver; a little health, and much lameneſs; a great journey, and but a few ſteps; the work is rather in deſire, and much in complaints; and though perhaps little be done, yet all is heartily endeavoured to be done; this I call the Initials of Repentance.</p>
               <p>There are ſix things ſhew that Repentance is begun in truth. <note place="margin">Six things ſhew Repentance is begun in truth. Condemnation.</note> 1. One is <hi>Condemnation:</hi> When the judgement looks upon all ſin after another manner then formerly, ſentencing it as the moſt vile, and accurſed of all evils, and no ſin (knowingly) finds favour. 2. Another is <hi>Averſation:</hi> When the will flies, <note place="margin">Averſation.</note> and ſhuns it, as that, which is moſt contrary to all goodneſs, and happineſs. 3. A third is <hi>Wearineſs:</hi> When the Soul is as <note place="margin">Wearineſs.</note> weary of Sin, as any Porter can be of his Burthen, or as a ſick-man is of his Bed. Pſal. 51. 17. <hi>The ſacrifices of God, are a broken ſpirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> 4. A fourth is <hi>Lamentation:</hi> That the Soul cannot yet be rid of <note place="margin">Lamentation.</note> the unruly motions, and inſolencies of ſin; It is grieved, that Life and Death, Hell and Heaven, Grace and Sin ſhould thus be together. 5. A fifth is <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> or conflict: The Soul doth <note place="margin">Reſiſtance.</note> uſe the beſt means it can, to ſeparate more from ſin, and all ſinfull wayes, and to walk only in all holy pathes, in the pathes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And the ſixth is <hi>an active Inctination,</hi> to obey God in all things; a thirſting and ſtriving, an aiming, a writing after the Copy. <note place="margin">An active In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And there are four things, which do ſhew that Repentance is <note place="margin">Four things ſhew that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is but begun. Impotency.</note> but begun, it is only initial. 1. One is <hi>Impotency,</hi> or weakneſs of operation: When the penitential parts do move and ſtir, yet like a child, who begins to go very feebly. There is as much
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115664:84"/> appears in the courſe, as declares another ſpring or principle, and rule, by which the Soul ſtrives to walk, but the performance is very tender and feeble; like a young Tree that hath but tender branches, and ſmall fruit: The perſon doth mourn, and confeſs, and pray, and live, and obey, but with weakneſs. 2. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>efficacy of Temptation:</hi> When Temptations do eaſily <note place="margin">Efficacy of Temptation.</note> beſet and diſcourage the Soul; as when the Tree is but a young plant, the Winds to toſs it, and make it reel; ſo when Temptations do, as it were, drive the Soul, and are apt to raiſe quick fears, and diſcouragements: Oh! I ſhall be overcome again, I ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold on, I cannot well ſee how I ſhall be able to perform, and preſerve in theſe wayes which I have choſen. A third is the <hi>Validity of preſent Corruption;</hi> which though it be truly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and bewailed, yet it is very apt upon occaſions to aſſault and <note place="margin">Validity of preſent Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> prevail; when every little ſtone is apt to make one ſtumble, it argues that the ſtrength is weak. 4. <hi>Neceſſary preſence of many helps:</hi> When a Man cannot go, but with two Crutches; and a Child muſt lean upon many props, and a penitent upon many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible encouragements.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe Initials of Repentance are graciouſly accepted <note place="margin">The Doctrine proved. God reſpects the truth as well as the degrees of Grace.</note> of God, may be thus manifeſted. 1. <hi>The Lord doth reſpect the truth of Grace, as well as the degrees of it,</hi> every quality as well as the quantity. <hi>Are not thine eyes upon the truth?</hi> The Goldſmith hath his eye on the very thin raies of Godl, as well as on the great knobs and pieces; Grace is excellent and amiable at the loweſt, though then admirable when at higheſt. 2. <hi>The main thing that God looks upon, is to the heart; (My Son, give me thy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God looks moſt at the Heart.</note> 
                  <hi>heart:)</hi> All that is done, if the heart be not in it, it is of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no eſtimation with God; but if the heart be right, this the Lord prizeth exceedingly, and ſo much, that for its ſake, he paſſeth by many infirmities. <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart.</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. 19. Now in the Initials of Repentance, the heart is ſet right; it is ſet on God, and towards God in truth. 3. <hi>Even the Initials of Repentance are his own Gifts</hi> (ſpecial gifts of his bleſſed Spirit) it is he that <hi>worketh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Initials of Repentance are his Ciſt.</note> 
                  <hi>in us to will and to do, Phil.</hi> 2. 13. The ſpirituall will, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deed (though both be imperfect) yet are they the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine effect of Gods own ſpirit; ſparks out of his fire, works of his own hands: Now as in the Creation, God looked upon all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115664:85"/> that he made, and ſaw that it was good, he liked it well. So is it in our Renovation; all that good which God works in us, he doth accept and approve, he doth not deſpiſe his own image, which though it ſhine more fairly in progreſſive Repentance, yet is it truly ſtampt in our initial Converſion. 4.

Why! it were well if thou hadſt, and thou doeſt not well, if thou ſtriveſt not beyond all the meaſure of grace which thou doeſt attain: But then to think, that onely great grace is in grace with God, and not little grace; Repentance grown, and not Repentance begun; that God will not look on drops, but rivers; not on weakneſs, but ſtrength onely; that a poor, contrite, broken, troubled ſoul, which prizeth grace above heaven, and hates ſin above hell, but yet is troubled with the preſence of much corruption, and is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of manifold wants in all kinds of grace, that the Lord will never look upon ſuch a thin, new, weak Chriſtian, unleſs with auſterity and diſtance: Why do we thus belie the Lord? and falſifie the graciouſneſs of the Almighty? who doth ſo love ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and delight in the converſion of a ſinner, that as ſoon as ever the ſinner begins truly to repent, the Lord hath thoughts of mercy and peace for him, he is obſerved and accepted, <hi>(Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias is preſently ſent to Paul,)</hi> meſſengers of peace are preſently diſpatched, Patents of mercy are ſealed for him.</p>

I beſeech you, let us pauſe a while: 1. <hi>Are all in our Family Men?</hi> Are there not ſome Children, perhaps new-born Babes? Are all in the Flock ſtrong Sheep? are there not ſome Lambs (perhaps)

Do you deſpiſe Children? reject the Lambs? or ſlight the Moon, becauſe of her ſpots, and leſſer light than that of the Sun? Why! we read of the like diſparity in the heavenly courſe: St. <hi>John</hi> tells us of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of <hi>Young-men,</hi> and of <hi>Chidren</hi> too, yea, and of <hi>Babes;</hi> and Chriſt adviſed <hi>Peter</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as well unto the <hi>Lambs,</hi> as unto the <hi>Sheep.</hi> 2. <hi>Were not we Beginners once our ſelves?</hi> Was our Sun at the top? our Gold ſo exquiſitely pure? did not we then need compaſſions and helps in times of infancy, weakneſs, conflicts, temptations?

               <p>But why is God ſo ready to ſhew mercy to the penitent perſon? <hi>Sol.</hi> There are reaſons, partly reſpecting God, and the penitent. <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> 1. In reſpect of God. 1. <hi>It is his nature</hi> to be the <hi>Lord, the Lord God, gracious, merciful, abundant in goodneſs and truth, forgiving iniquity,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In reſpect of God. It is his nature.</note> 
                  <hi>tranſgreſſion, and ſin;</hi> therefore called a Father, and the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> a Husband, Friend, Phyſician: Every nature is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or ſend out ſuch acts as lye within it, and are ſuitable unto it, The Fire is apt to heat, and the Sun to ſhine, and the Water to moiſten: The liberal man, it is his nature to be apt to give, and the courteous man to ſpeak kindly; the nature of the Lord is merciful, and therefore no wonder, that he is ready to ſhew mercy. 2. <hi>It</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</note> 
                  <hi>is his promiſe</hi> to ſhew mercy to the penitent; his nature is ready to pity any man in miſery, and to offer him mercy and help; but beſides this, he is ready to make good his promiſes, he hath paſſed his holy word of truth, that he will have mercy on the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; the promiſes are ſo many that I cannot mention them, See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. &amp;c. 3. <hi>It is his delight</hi> to ſhew them <note place="margin">It is his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</note> mercy; <hi>he delighteth in mercy.</hi> Mic. 7. 18. What any delights in, that he is ready to do; there is nothing more facile to action, or more abundant in action, or more unweariable in action, then delight; delight is no burden: when God ſhews mercy, he is doing that, wherein he delights. Two things God delights in, One is, a penitent ſoul (there <hi>is joy in heaven for his converſion,)</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, to ſhew mercy to that Soul. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8. <hi>I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have ſinned againſt me.</hi> v. 9. <hi>And it ſhall be to me a name of joy.</hi> 4. <hi>It is his glory:</hi> is it the glory <note place="margin">It is his glory.</note> of a man to paſs by an offence, and is it not the glory of a God mercifully to paſs over tranſgreſſions? you get by it, and God gets by it. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. 18. <hi>Therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you;</hi> there be many things which do exalt God, (ſet his glory on high;) our humility doth it, our faith doth it, and his own mercies do it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 9. <hi>This ſhall be to me a name of joy and praiſe, and an honour before all the nations of the earth;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115664:90"/> who ſhall hear all the good that I do unto you.</hi> When he pardons a ſinner and ſhews him mercy, why now he gets him a Name; <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin?</hi> God gets him a name three wayes; ſometimes by <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> acts, as when he works wonders: never was the like ſeen in Iſrael. Sometimes by <hi>Vindictive</hi> acts, as when he over rules and confounds the great enemies of his people; ſo he got him a name upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Sometimes by his <hi>Gracious</hi> acts, as when he pardons a ſinner. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets it down for all poſterity to look on that mercy which was ſhewed unto him. The Lord gives the Penitent mercy, and hereby he gets unto himſelf much Glory. 5. <hi>His love is great to Penitents,</hi> and therefore his mercy is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">His love is great to Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</note> for penitents: his general Love, his Philanthropie inclines him thus far as to reveale mercy, and to offer mercy, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech by mercy, even the unkindeſt Impenitents, <hi>Why will ye dy? turn and live: When ſhall it once be?</hi> O then what muſt his ſpecial love produce? if he be ready to ſhew mercy to enemies, is he not ready to ſhew it to ſons? If to Rebels, ſurely then to friends? if to them that diſobey him, how much to them who do humble themſelves at his footſtool? who repent, for whoſe ſouls he gave the blood of his Son?</p>
               <p>Secondly in <hi>reſpect of the penitent</hi> themſelves, God is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">In reſpect of the Penitent.</note> to ſhew them mercy. 1. <hi>There is nothing in the World that they need like mercy:</hi> It is the only Plaiſter for their wound, and <note place="margin">They need no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> Anchor for their Ship; if they have not mercy, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Uſually there is in every condition ſome one thing, which the heart of man doth moſt need; if he be ſick, then health; if poor, then ſufficiency; if dejected, then comfort; <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells <hi>Martha</hi> of <hi>one thing that was neceſſary:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> he hath <hi>one thing to deſire of the Lord;</hi> and the penitent perſon he hath one needful requeſt too, <hi>O that God would be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> ſo the Publicane. 2. <hi>If God were not ready to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>

Is it a ſmall thing, think you, to dwell with everlaſting burnings? to ſee nothing but ſin, and Hell? No, No, the Lord knows what the ſeverity of his wrath
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115664:90"/> is, and he knows what the Impotency of the ſoul is, and he knows what the terrour of a troubled conſcience is, how it ſinks, and cracks if no hope of mercy appears; and therefore he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready to ſhew mercy to the penitent, leſt deſpair ſhould overwhelm them: deſpair is ready to riſe in two caſes; One is when there is exceeding tenderneſs and ſenſibleneſs of ſin; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, when there is a long abſence and improbability of mercy; for what hath the ſoul now to reſt on, and to ſupport it? Now off all perſons living there are none ſo ſenſible of ſin, as true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents; (we may ſay of other people, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>the reſt are hardned)</hi> and of all penitent people, they are moſt tender in conſcience, and apprehenſive of ſin, and fearfull about mercy, who are newly converted from a ſinful way: O how hard is it to keep them above water, to perſwade them that any mercy belongs to them? and therefore the Lord is ready to ſhew them mercy, that their ſpirits might not fail before him, nor be overwhelmed with deſpair.</p>

But judge not of duties by the opinion of ignorant and graceleſs men; nor by the folly and error of your own ſinful and inexperienced hearts. No,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115664:91"/> but judge of them by what the Word pronounceth of them, in themſelves, and by their ends. Is Salvation a deſireable thing? is mercy an excellent thing?

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Gods reconciled favour is a thing demonſirable to a fitted ſoul;</hi> (.i.) it is not beſides the nature of Divine favour, to open it ſelf ſo that it may be apprehended, no more then it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of Light, to reveal it ſelf. Nor is it beyond the capacity and proportion of a penitential ſoul tobe cognoſcitive, (i.) to be able to look on, and know Divine favour. In <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſali,</hi> the Papiſts and others do grant, as, That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf: but more then this, I affirm in particulars, There is not only a Notional knowledge in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but there may be an Experimental knowledg in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Divine favour. <hi>By this,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>I know thou favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt me.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Who loved me.</hi> God hath actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifeſted his love and favour to his people of old; <hi>Son, be of good comfort, thy ſins are for given thee,</hi> Mat. 9. And <hi>Rom. 8. Paul</hi> had it, and all the Saints had it: And he doth manifeſt it, and will manifeſt it to all true penitents. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a double manifeſtation of his favour; One is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A double Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his favour. Naturall.</note> and this is when God doth imprint ſuch qualities on the ſoul, which are the ſole fruits of a reconciled Love, as when he beſtowes on it the ſanctifying graces of his Spirit; Another is <hi>Formal,</hi> wherein he doth evidently make over the goodneſs of <note place="margin">Formall.</note> his Love, (i.) make us directly to know that he doth love us, and is reconciled unto us: which is done two wayes, either, 1. <hi>By the Teſtimony of the Word</hi> apprehended by faith; 2. <hi>By the Teſtimony of his Spirit,</hi> cauſing in us an expreſs evidence and ſenſe of Gods love, as a witneſs, and as a ſeal. Now one of theſe wayes God is pleaſed to manifeſt his reconciled favour, or to evidence it unto the penitential ſoul, and ſometimes both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The time which God taketh to declare or make known</hi> (in a <note place="margin">The time of this manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But even now, though the foundations of the earth be ſhaken, the aſſured perſon, who knows God is reconciled to him, knows alſo that his foundation of love ſtands ſure and firm, and through all, does he make his addreſs unto the God of his mercies, and ſhall find acceptance with him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>You may perhaps reply unto me, this evidence that God is reconciled to us (which is ſo excellent in it ſelf, and produces ſuch effects) were a very heaven upon earth, if we could attain unto it. But <hi>what means ſhould we uſe, that we may at length enjoy it:</hi>

The Internal means are three, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſcience, the Spirit of God, and Faith; for all theſe have in them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive, and an evidencing virtue or power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Then, you muſt get your conſciences renewed:</hi> Conſcience, <note place="margin">Get your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences renewed.</note> abſolutely conſidered, hath a reflexing power, it can look on our natural acts and conditions; but it muſt be conſcience renewed, which muſt teſtifie of the ſpiritual eſtate, and that God is reconciled to you. The teſtimony or evidence of conſcience renewed, is (you know) ſyllogiſtical, and nothing elſe but the eccho of the word, <hi>v. g.</hi> whoſoever truly repents of ſin, the Lord is reconciled to him; this is the propoſition of the word, as you may read in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. They are deſcribed, as acting the parts of true penitents; and then v. 4. <hi>I will love them freely:</hi> So Jer. 31. 19. Ephraim <hi>is turned,</hi> and repents, and then v. 20. Ephraim <hi>is a dear child, and a pleaſant Son;</hi> he is earneſtly remembred, and ſure mercy is his;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115664:101"/> (.i.) <hi>Ephraim</hi> is reconciled, and dearly loved of God. Here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed conſcience aſſumes, But I do unfainedly repent, I do truly mourn, and forſake ſin; and now with aſſurance, it concludes by way of evidence and teſtimony, Therefore the Lord is reconciled unto me, he doth freely and ſurely love me. <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is objected, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be deceived; it may aſſume without ground, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludingly conclude the matter. <hi>Sol.</hi> I grant that conſcience may be erronious in its grounds, but conſcience as renewed, and concluding as a renewed conſcience, will not delude you, nor err; for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence renewed, concludes not upon an empty imagination, but upon a ſolid examination of the heart and life. It finds that integrity in the heart, and that uprightneſs in ordering the life, which doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the word of God; And reading that the <hi>Lord loves the upright, and that he will ſhew his ſalvation to him that orders his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright:</hi> Now upon ſearch, finding this habitual and actual uprightneſs, it concludes, Surely I am the perſon whom the Lord loves, and to whom he is reconciled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You muſt get the ſpirit of God:</hi> The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. <note place="margin">Get the ſpirit of God.</note> ſaith, that the <hi>love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo that if ever you would know the love of God unto you, you muſt have the ſpirit of God: the ſpirit of God hath many operations given unto him, as that he <hi>inlightens</hi> the mind, <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> the heart, <hi>ſanctifies</hi> it, and then that he <hi>ſealeth</hi> and <hi>comforteth</hi> it; and as theſe effects, ſo the order of them is obſervable; he doth not firſt of all ſeal or aſſure, and then inlighten, and then ſanctifie, and then humble; but he firſt inlightens, humbles, ſanctifies and converts the ſoul, and then aſſures and comforts it: Peruſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. you ſhall find, that <hi>the witneſs of the ſpirit that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> v. 16. <hi>followes the ſpirit of bondage, and of adoption, and of ſupplication,</hi> v. 15. <hi>and the quickning of the ſpirit,</hi> v. 11. <hi>and a leading of the ſpirit, v.</hi> 14. So that if ever you would be aſſured that the Lord is reconciled to you, you muſt get his ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, humbling, renewing, and leading you; ſo much evidence as you have of holineſs, ſo much aſſurance you may build on of Gods reconciled favour unto you. <hi>Obj.</hi> But here alſo it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, we may <hi>thus be cozened with Enthuſiaſms,</hi> taking a fond dream and deluſion, for a witneſſing or teſtimony of Gods ſpirit. <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, this is a fond and ridiculous exception; for the ſpirit of God (as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks) can neither deceive, nor be deceived.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115664:101"/> The ſealing or aſſuring teſtimony of Gods Spirit, is never <hi>Nudum</hi> nor <hi>Nudatum teſtimonium;</hi> but as it is a ſeal to a deed drawn, (I mean an heart firſt written over with renewing graces;) ſo in the ſealing, it alwayes produceth more tender and lively operations of holineſs, in all good works.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, If you would get aſſurance of Gods love reconciled unto your ſouls, <hi>you muſt get Faith.</hi> Faith is the eye, by which we <note place="margin">Get Faith.</note> look on God, and it is that light, by which we ſee God looking on us: How did Simeon <hi>ſee Chriſt</hi> to be his <hi>Saviour?</hi> Or <hi>Paul know that Chriſt loved him,</hi> but by <hi>Faith?</hi> There are two wayes by which Faith can and will bring the ſoul to ſee or know God reconciled unto it: One is, <hi>by and in Chriſt;</hi> there is no ſeeing of a reconciled God, but in a Mediator, and therefore Chriſt is called ſo often our Peace, our Atonement, our Reconciler: The other is, <hi>by and through the Promiſes,</hi> which is therefore called the Covenant of Grace; <hi>q. d.</hi> ſets forth, and preſents God unto us, as graciouſly reconciled. If you have ſo much faith as will bring you to Chriſt, to know him, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and accept of him, to rely on him, you may with ſafeſt confidence conclude and be perſwaded, that God is your reconciled God: <hi>For God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The external means</hi> of obtaining aſſurance are: 1. <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">External means. Diligent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our ſelves to the Word.</note> 
                  <hi>and diligent application of our ſelves to the Word.</hi> The word of God is both the inſtrument of our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and of our <hi>Conſolation;</hi> and is not only productive of faith, as it is an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but able alſo to produce it, as it is an evidence: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you read that faith in acceptance depends on the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. ſo we read that faith in aſſurance flowes likewiſe from it. 1 Joh. 5. 13. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life.</hi> And as the Word is oftentimes called a Word of Faith, ſo it is ſometimes called a Lip of Peace. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 19. <hi>q.</hi> it produceth an aſſurance from which that peace doth flow. 2. <hi>And to the Sacrament.</hi> The Sacrament hath, I confeſs, many <note place="margin">To the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ends; and it is (as the Word of God is) an Organ or Inſtrument of the Divine ſpirit, for much good unto believing ſouls. Among the reſt, it hath a ſingular virtue to breed aſſurance of Gods love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called, a <hi>Seal</hi> in <hi>Ro.</hi> 4. 11. In it Chriſt Jeſus (in whom God is reconciled) is moſt diſtinctly repreſented in his Paſſion, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace by his blood for our ſouls: In it the ſame Chriſt Jeſus is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115664:102"/> particularly offered and applyed unto us, with all the benefits and efficacies of his perſon: <hi>Take, eat, this is my body which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24. As if God ſhould ſay, As ſurely as I give thee this bread and wine, ſo I give thee my Son, and the purchaſe of his death, even reconciliation, and pardon, and mercy. A believing celebration of the Sacrament is a moſt admirable means to remove our doubts, and to eſtabliſh our hearts with an <note place="margin">Fervent and patient Prayer.</note> aſſurance that God is reconciled unto us. 3. <hi>Fervent and patient Prayer;</hi> prizing the favour of God, as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 63. 3. Hungring and thirſting after it, as he hid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 4, 5. And thus continuing to ſeek with diligence, being withall tenderly careful in our hearts and wayes to pleaſe the Lord; we ſhall have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of our Souls crowned with the teſtimonies of his love here, and with the full glory of his face, and favour hereafter.</p>

               <p>But for our parts, if any of us upon a penitential courſe have been ſo far bleſſed as to ſee the face of God with peace, and have found any teſtimony of his pardoning mercy, let us never ceaſe to bleſs that mercy, and with mournful and ſelf-judging hearts to iterate and continue our confeſſion of the ſins for which we have found mercy.</p>

So is it in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of confeſſion of ſin; to confeſs under the beams of mercy is a better temper then to confeſs under the ſtrokes of Juſtice; it argues a more holy Ingenuity to acknowledg and bewail our vileneſs, being diſcharged of wrath and puniſhment, then only to exclaim either upon the Rack, or upon hopes to be taken off.</p>

               <p>There is another implicit Obſervation from the carriage of the Father to this penitential Prodigal upon his Confeſſion.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>but wholly expreſſeth himſelf in love and kindneſs.</hi> There are two Branches of this Aſſertion; 1. <hi>One, that God takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of former ſins upon our true Repentance.</hi> There is a threefold notice of ſin in reſpect of God; 1. <hi>Notitia Intuitiva;</hi> which is his all obſerving eye of Omniſcience, from which nothing can be hid; but every Creature, and operation of the Creature, whether open or ſecret, is viſible and manifeſt unto God: that diſtinction of known and unknown, ſecret and open, hath no place in God, to whoſe eye all things are naked. In this reſpect the former ſins of a penitent fall within Gods notice; for the goodneſs of Divine Mercy doth not blind-fold the eye of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Omniſcience. 2. <hi>Notitia Charitativa;</hi> which is a notice of ſins, as a kind Creditor takes notice of Debts owing unto him, and ſet down in his book, his eye is on them, and his Pen alſo to croſs and daſh them out. And in this reſpect alſo God takes notice of former ſins, namely, ſo as out of rich love,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115664:105"/> and gracious favour to croſs and forgive them: unleſs we will fondly imagine that God forgives ſins by hap-chance, at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, never ſeeing and conſidering what he doth. 3. <hi>Notitia Vindictiva;</hi> which is a Judiciary notice, as a Judge takes notice <note place="margin">Notitia Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictiva.</note> of the evil facts of a Malefactor to Condemn him, or to trouble and vex him. In this reſpect, upon true Repentance, God takes no notice of former ſins, <hi>(.i.)</hi> either <hi>to condemn the penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for them,</hi> or, <hi>to upbraid him</hi> and diſhearten him by caſting them into his diſh, or hitting of him in the teeth, as we ſpeak Proverbially. Hence thoſe phraſes in the Scripture upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Repentance, Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> Not that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance makes God forgetful (for he is no: capable of ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as Oblivion) but that when men ceaſe to ſin, God will ceaſe to argue and ſpeak with them after a Judicial manner for their ſins. So Ezek. 18. 21. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed;</hi> ver. 22. <hi>All his tranſgreſſions which he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him;</hi> he means, in any harſh, judicial, and cutting way. More ſuch phraſes there are, as, that he will cover our ſins, caſt them into the depths of the ſea, and caſt them behind his back; and though they be ſought for, yet they ſhall not be found.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Branch is, that he expreſſeth <hi>himſelf wholly in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">He expreſſeth himſelf wholly in love and kindneſs.</note> 
                  <hi>love and kindneſs;</hi> the which is moſt evident in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. when <hi>Ephraim</hi> repented and confeſſed his ſin, all the expreſſions now from God are full of tender Love, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child? I do earneſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remember him ſtill,</hi> (Ephraim thinks that I have forgotten him, that I regard him not, but there is no ſuch matter;) <hi>my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him. Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2, 3. Iſrael is repenting, and confeſſing, and praying, and how doth God anſwer him? See <hi>v. 4. I will heal their back-ſlidings, I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from him.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet here we muſt diſtinguiſh, 1. Twixt <hi>Gods expreſſions,</hi> which <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh Twix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>this excellent truth, That none is like Chriſt for a ſinner;</hi> That he is the only Saviour and Redeemer; and that ſuch an offer of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt unto a ſinner, is worthy of all acceptation; the ſinner is made for ever if he can get Chriſt, and he periſhes for ever if he enjoyes him not. As a woman in a diſpoſition to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſhe conſiders of the perſon, and his qualities, and condition, and thinks often, This man hath choice parts in him, a good eſtate, I cannot better my ſelf if I refuſe him, I ſee I may do very well if I match unto him. Anſwerable effects doth Faith work in the ſoul, it doth make the minde of a man
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115664:113"/> to ſee the ſuperlative excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, and to fall in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him and them. Come, I need a Saviour; Chriſt is he, and none elſe; he is the Prince of my peace, the Lord of my life; his Nature is excellent, Redemption ſufficient and proper, Laws righteous and good; it is my wiſdome, it is my ſafety, it is my ſalvation to accept of him, and to beſtow my ſoul on him.</p>

It is granted, that to embrace, or to be willing, or to conſent, are the acts of the will; but to embrace Chriſt with a conjugal conſent, to be willing to beſtow our ſelves on him, this comes from faith enabling the Will ſo to will. Not by way of coaction, for the Will cannot be compelled; nor doth Faith work in a violent way, though it works in an effectual way, enabling the Will to a free election of Chriſt before all others, <hi>(i.)</hi> predominant cauſes in Chriſt, to accept of him, and to reſign up to him, rather than to ſin, or world, or any thing elſe; and when the Will is wrought upon, ſo as to accept of Chriſt in his Perſon, and Offices, and Eſtates, the ſoul is now matched or married to Chriſt by Faith. It beſtows it ſelf, and gives Chriſt all the right, and cleaves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in an indiſſoluble bond of affection and ſervice.</p>

Abjice tectum &amp; tolle coelum,</hi> ſaid one. The repentant perſon forſakes his ſins, but preſently finds a Saviour; he is divorced from that which would damn him, and by faith is eſpouſed unto one that will ſave him. 2. <hi>To ſupport the ſoul of the penitent, which of all other is moſt ſick and heavy laden:</hi> It is moſt ſenſible of ſin, and guilt, and Gods diſpleaſure, on all which it cannot long look alone. If the penitent perſon had not faith to ſee a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, he would not long have an eye to look upon his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is a truth, that Repentance could never act it ſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the penitent perſon had faith to act it ſelf too. The ſorrow in Repentance would infinitely ſink into deſpair, and the forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin would turn into a forſaking of God, if Faith ſaw not a Mediatour for Tranſgreſſions, and a mercifull God through him. 3.

We tell you that Chriſt is better than all the world, his bloud is better than ſin, it's better to love and ſerve him than world or ſin; but who believes our report?

The like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doth Faith produce, if it eſpouſeth us to Chriſt, it ſets up Chriſt above all, accounts of him as moſt excellent, judgeth of all other things but as droſs and dung in compariſon of him, will part with all for to get Chriſt: The beauties of Chriſt are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of every believer; Chriſt doth not ſeem a mean thing, an ordinary or common thing; but he is the Pearl, the Sun of Righteouſneſs: <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> In a word, Faith (if right) exalts the Excellency of Chriſt, and the Authority of Chriſt; the Excellencies of his Perſon, and the Authority of his Will and Laws. 2. <hi>Election:</hi>

Do we find this love in our hearts to Chriſt, againſt all, and above all? Nay again, True conjugal love infers with it a Love, 1. <hi>of Complacency,</hi> to delight in the thing loved; 2. <hi>of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> to be with the perſon loved: Is it ſo with us? what delght have we in Chriſt? in his perſon, in his excellencies, in his works, in his ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It ſubjects thy will to Chriſts will, and thy judgment to his truths, and thy deſire to his rule, and thy works to his laws. If Chriſt would have thee be and do one thing, and thou wilt be and do another, that thy will is ſtill contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting of Chriſts will, and thy way is ſtill contrary to his way: Though a man may be married to ſuch a ſtubborn and perverſe piece, yet Chriſt is not; for all that are married unto him by Faith, have in ſome meaſure wrought in them, an obediential ſpirit, deſirous to know the mind of the Lord, and willing to live godly in Chriſt Jeſus.

Now our feet can bring us to the Courts of God, and now we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably prize and uſe communion with God; we take more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light a thouſand times to read his Word, than all Play-books, and merry Hiſtories; to hear the voice of Chriſt, to be reforming of what is evil, to be much in Prayer, and all the works of holy Obedience, than in any wicked or vain way whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It cannot but be thus, if you conſider 1. <hi>The principle which is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">From the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which is implanted in them.</note> 
                  <hi>implanted in them:</hi> As things are in being, ſo they are in working; that nature which is moſt predominant in any, hath ſtill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the actions in him. Doth the penitent now live an heavenly life? Why, God hath given unto him a ſpiritual, and heavenly nature; <hi>He is made pertaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> which of all others is moſt holy, and ſpiritual, and heavenly. Doth he order his life by the rule of the Word? Why, the Word of God is ingraffed in him, and abides in him in the virtues and efficacies of it, ſo that he was converted by it, and will now be guided by it. Doth he lead an upright life? Why, the Lord hath taken from him the ſpirit of guile and deceitfulneſs, and hath given unto him an <hi>One heart,</hi> a plain, ſincere, perfect, or upright heart; a right heart which cannot abide doubling, and dividing, and hollowneſs, but it is of the truth; there is <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> and therefore there is truth in the outward acts. Doth he lead a ſingle life for Divine Glory? Why, he hath received real grace from God, which will work only for God; the Waters which come from the Sea, will run into the Sea again. Doth he live a profitable life? Why, it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true grace, and true repentance to make us as active in a good way, as we were violent in a bad; the nature of Good is to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115664:119"/> diffuſive, as the nature of fire is to heat, and of the Sun is to give light: <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul.)</hi> Doth he adorn his holy profeſſion with an anſwerable converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why! how can it be otherwiſe, but that gracious habits, ſhould breed gracious acts; and glorious qualities, ſhould breed glorious effects?

               <p>2. <hi>The peculiar diſpoſition of Repentance.</hi> Repentance in <note place="margin">From the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſpoſition of Repentance.</note> the proper nature produceth two effects. 1. One in <hi>newneſs of life:</hi> It is againſt the truth of Repentance for a man to live the ſame life, to keep on the ſame courſe, for this is impenitency; not converſion, but continuation; not a regreſs, but a progreſs; not a change of life, but a courſe of the ſame life: But when Repentance comes, change comes; for what is repentance but the new purpoſe for a new life? A man muſt be what he was not, and do that which he never did, and run an other courſe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he did; <hi>put off the old converſation, and put on a new; Ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well;</hi> put off the ſervice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and become the ſervant of holineſs: this is to be a penitent. 2. Another is <hi>revenge:</hi> you know the Apoſtle makes this one of the fruits of godly ſorrow and repentance; <hi>yea what revenge?</hi> 2. Cor. 7. Now this revenge, as it conſiſts in many other things, ſo in this eſpecially; that as we have imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſoules and bodies in wicked acts to ſerve againſt the Lord to his diſhonor, ſo now we imploy and improve them in holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the proper glory of God; now we buſy them, to know him, to love him, to obey him, to honour him: The penitent perſon is ſo ſenſible of the infinite diſhonour which God hath had by his ſinful life, that if he had now a thouſand ſouls and bodies, and ten thouſand lives, all were little enough in all holineſs of Converſation to redeem thoſe diſhonours, and repair them.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The peculiar intentions which God hath towards penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>

                  <hi>unto their Conſciences;</hi> a peace which paſſeth all underſtanding, and a joy which paſſeth all expreſſion; even that which ſprings from his gracious favour and reconciliation with them in Chriſt, which both pacifies the conſcience, and alſo quickens and revives it. But this could not be, unleſs he enabled them to new and better lives; the life of holineſs is the only path of peace, that of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is a way which knows not peace; there is no peace unto wicked men, nor unto wicked wayes. And for Joy, that only breeds joy in conſcience, which makes the conſcience not to accuſe, but excuſe; not to torment, but comfort; only the new life is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly joyful and comfortable life; there are no ſpirits in the life which is not ſpiritual. 3. <hi>He doth intend much outward mercy to them:</hi> See how full the field of bleſſings is to the penitent; but it <note place="margin">And much outward mercy to them.</note> is upon this condition, If his life be obedient; as it were upon his good behaviour, If ye conſent and obey ye ſhall eat the good of the Land. 4. <hi>He doth intend them Glory before men, and Glory</hi>

Now the ſpots of Leproſie fall off from <hi>Naoman,</hi> and his fleſh grows clear and fair; but how ſhould this Sun break out, if the clouds ſtill remaine?

                  <hi>That every ſinfull or unconverted man is a loſt man. [This my ſon was loſt.]</hi> There are two ſorts of ſinners in Scripture, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Every ſinfull unconverted man is a loſt man.</note> who are ſtiled loſt. 1. <hi>Finally impenitent:</hi> Theſe are irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loſt; loſt, and never found. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> was loſt; <hi>None of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition,</hi> Joh. 17. 1. And of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3. 2. <hi>Temporary wanderers;</hi> who <hi>quantum ad ſtatum preſentem</hi> are loſt, but <hi>quoad decretum de futuro</hi> ſhall be found: To theſe that ſaying ſeems to refer, in <hi>Luk. 19. 10. The Son of Man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Again, One may be ſaid to be loſt, 1. who is ſtept out of the way: Every ſinning is a ſtraying, and every ſtraying is a kind of loſtneſs; thus even a converted man is many times loſt. <hi>I have gone aſtray</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 170.) <hi>like a loſt ſheep. 2. Who is not as yet come into the way:</hi> Thus the unconverted man is loſt. <hi>Pſal. 58. 3. The wicked are eſtranged from the womb;</hi> they go aſtray as ſoon as they be born. And <hi>Pſal. 14. 3. They are gone aſide.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 9. 12. They are all gone out of the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now an unconverted man may be called a loſt man, in eight <note place="margin">And may be ſo called in eight reſpects. He hath loſt his God.</note> reſpects. Becauſe, 1. <hi>He hath loſt his God:</hi> Every man (at the firſt) had God to be his God; but man ſinned, and by ſin every man loſt God: We never loſe our ſelves, but when we loſe our God; and we never loſe our God, but by ſinning. There was one once, <hi>who loſt his Kingdome for a draught of Water;</hi> and <note place="margin">Lyſimachus.</note> we, in <hi>Adam,</hi> loſt our God for rhe taſte of an <hi>Apple.</hi> This is a great loſs, to loſe our God. A Child may loſe his Father, and yet live; the Mariner may loſe his Anchor, and yet ſail: But if the World doth loſe the Sun, it loſeth all; But if Man loſeth his God, he loſeth him who is better than All. There are four great loſſes in that one loſs of God: There is a loſs, 1. of the <hi>Image of God,</hi> that Royal Crown is gone; 2. of the <hi>Favour of God,</hi> that friendly look is gone; 3. of the <hi>Society of God,</hi> that ſweet fruition is gone; 4. of the <hi>Happineſs of God,</hi> that onely life is gone: A Juſt God remains ſtill, and a Mighty God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill; but the Gracious God is loſt, but the Bleſſed God is loſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>He hath loſt his Paradiſe:</hi> Paradiſe was the garden of <note place="margin">Loſt his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</note> bleſſings, and of all delights; and ſome conjecture, that all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs

The child of diſobedience is only an heir of the curſe; <hi>Write that man childleſs,</hi> ſaid God of <hi>Coniah;</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of an unconverted ſinner, Write that man comfortleſs. Or as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid of <hi>Paſhur,</hi> Thou ſhalt be called <hi>Magor-miſſabib, terrour round about;</hi> the ſame may be affirmed of this ſinner, He is exiled from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and bleſſing, there is no peace unto him, no bleſſing; he cannot juſtly expect one crop of mercy, not one good day all his days; the womb is a priſon, the world a ſea, ſin a grave, life a wilderneſs, death an hell, to a wicked man.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>He hath loſt his ſoul:</hi> And what is left when my ſoul is loſt? There are divers kinds of loſſes; ſome Loſſes are Gain <note place="margin">Loſt his ſoul.</note> to us, (ſuch was <hi>Pauls loſs,</hi> Phil. 3.) Some Loſſes are a Pain to us, a little diminution, an excire onely of this or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; ſome loſe Sin, and get Chriſt; ſome loſe Earth, and get Heaven; but no loſs like the loſs of the Soul: Now every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted man hath loſt this Jewel, this Soul of his: He hath loſt his Soul, 1. To <hi>Satan,</hi> who hath the dominion and uſe of it, he rules, and he works mightily in it, and over it; a wicked mans ſoul is the Devils ſlave, he takes it captive at his pleaſure: 2. To <hi>a condemning and revenging God; The ſoul that ſins ſhall die;</hi> the Leaſe is forfeited; ſin forfeits the ſoul into the hands of a condemning God, and there it is ſtayed for ever, unleſs a price be paid by the bloud of Chriſt to ranſome and recover it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>He hath loſt his Excellencies:</hi> His Glory is departed. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Loſt his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</note> man doth not know what is become of created man; yea, he hath loſt theſe ſo long, that he knows not whether ever he had any of them, or no; whether he ever had ſuch an eye or Lamp of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite knowledge, whether he ever had ſuch a veſture of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whether he ever had ſuch a ſtock of ability and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for Obedience. As he once could not find <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor they know <hi>Jezabel</hi> to have been <hi>Jezabel;</hi> juſt ſo is it with a poor ſinner. He once was a child of Light, a ſon of Obedience, he was created holy and righteous: But what is become of all his created ſtock? <hi>But man dieth, and man giveth up the ghoſt, and where is he?</hi> Job 14. 10. So here, man hath ſinned, and man hath loſt all his excellencies, and where is he? <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> ſaid God: A ſad queſtion, Where art thou? An hour
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115664:123"/> ſince, <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Adam;</hi> but upon his ſinning, <hi>Adam,</hi> where is <hi>Adam?</hi> Where is righteous <hi>Adam?</hi> Where is <hi>Adam,</hi> who had power to believe, to love, to obey all my will? Where is he? and where is all this? All is loſt.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>He hath loſt his way,</hi> his way home: Every ſinfull man is <note place="margin">Loſt his way.</note> a wandring Meteor, a very Planet on earth; he is gone from the fold, as a ſilly ſheep; he is gone from his Fathers houſe, as a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Child; he is gone out of the right path, like a ſilly Traveller in the Wilderneſs. Sin puts us into a Maze, into a Labyrinth; we go from one ſin to another ſin, out of one by-path into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by-path; and the further we go in ſinfull paths, the more ſtill we go out of the way: But the right path which leads back to our God, O the ſinner hath not an eye to ſee it; and when he hath light to ſee it, yet he hath not an heart to turn unto it, nor feet to walk in it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>They are all gone out of the way;</hi> v. 17. <hi>The way of peace they have not known.</hi> Pſal. 95. 10. <hi>It is a people that do err in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.</hi> The loſt ſinner hath an erring mind, and an erring heart, and erring affections. There is but one way to come back to God, which is by Chriſt, <hi>(I am the way,</hi> &amp;c.) but the loſt ſinner knows not Chriſt, nor the way unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>He hath loſt his Ability:</hi> He who once had power to fall, <note place="margin">Loſt his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> being fallen, hath now no power to riſe any more; a ſelf-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is as impoſſible as a ſelf-creation: It muſt be light which finds that which is loſt, but ſinfull man is darkneſs; it muſt be ſtrength which raiſeth up one who is fallen, but loſt man is leſs than weakneſs. He who loſeth himſelf by ſin, muſt come back again by grace; but the natural man hath no grace, no not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it, no not a thought of it, no nothing of all of it. What Sin caſts down, Faith muſt ſet up; but the unconverted man doth not, nay, cannot believe; of himſelf he cannot: As all our powers were at firſt in <hi>Adams</hi> hands, ſo all our powers now are in Chriſts hands.</p>
               <p>7. The ſinner is alſo <hi>loſt in reſpect of his Title</hi> and <hi>Plea,</hi> and <note place="margin">Loſt in reſpect of his liberty.</note> in reſpect of his Liberty and Freedome, ſo that now every ſinner is a very ſlave and bondman. <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>how</hi> comes man to be <note place="margin">How man comes to be loſt.</note> a loſt man? I anſwer, Man came to be a loſt ſinner, Firſt, <hi>By Temptation:</hi> The Devil loſt his own happineſs, and by his cunning ſeducements, Man loſt his happineſs too.

Then an affectation of an higher condition; 4. A falſe perſwaſion of Gods threatning. Secondly, <hi>By his own will.</hi> And there were (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our original Liberty <hi>ad utrumlibet)</hi> four principal ſins which <note place="margin">By his own will.</note> brought us into our Loſtneſs: 1. <hi>Pride, 2. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, 3.

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This may be reſolved by theſe Queries: 1. Where is thy Home? 2. What is thy way? 3. When didſt thou return? 1. <hi>Every loſt man is a man afar off.

The Text ſaith, That he <hi>was gone into a far Countrey.</hi> When the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were loſt, where were they? <hi>Afar off,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 17. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were loſt, where were they? <hi>They are gone away far from me,</hi> Jer. 2. 5. A natural man is far from God, (take me right,) you can never find God and a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man together; his nature is far from God, and his thoughts are far from God, and his affections are far from God: O, he cannot endure the preſence of God, he cannot endure Holineſs, he cannot endure holy Ordinances, nor holy Services, nor holy Admonitions, nor holy Reproofs, nor any holy Communion; the further he is from theſe, the better doth he think his condition to be. A man is never at home till he hath a God, and till he ſtands in Gods preſence, and till he hath communion with his God: But the natural man, <hi>&amp;c. 2. Every loſt man is in a falſe way,</hi> in <note place="margin">Every loſt man is in a falſe way.</note> a by-way; his ways are ſinfull ways: The loſt man, he is out of the common and known Road; he is in the Woods, in the Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in the Deſerts, in the Fields, and he goes from one ſtrange place to another ſtrange place. O man! whileſt thou walkeſt after thy ſins, whileſt thou runneſt from ſin to ſin, whiles thy way and courſe of Life is in the fulfilling and following of thy Luſts, aſſuredly thou art a loſt man. 3. <hi>Didſt thou ever yet return to</hi>

And verily, there is no poor ſoul, whom God is finding and bringing home to himſelf, on whom he hath imprinted a true ſenſe of his loſtneſs, but preſently the ſoul cries out, What ſhall I do? what ſhall I do to be ſaved? O that I might have Chriſt! and O that I might be found in Jeſus Chriſt! Remember two things: 1. <hi>That the Lord will bring back to himſelf no ſoul, but by Jeſus Chriſt: Chriſt</hi> is the ſinners <hi>way</hi> to the Father; he is the <hi>door</hi> by which you are admitted: If ever the Lord caſts an eye on thee, or take thee by the hand, it is for his Chriſt's ſake. 2. <hi>A loſt ſoul,</hi> which is found, <hi>finds an abſolute need of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Nothing out of Chriſt can make peace, can juſtifie, can reconcile, can ſet us ſtraight, can make us accepted. Had I all other things, and had not Chriſt, I were ſtill a loſt perſon: Had I the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Angels, yet if I had not Chriſt, I were loſt; could I mourn, could I repent, could I pray, could I live holily, could I walk exactly, yet I am loſt; I am ſtill loſt, until I get into Chriſt. <hi>I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi> God will look on me as my Judge, he will look on me as his enemy, he will not own me as a Father, as a reconciled Father, but in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Theſe words do hold forth a pithy deſcription of a ſinners converſion; that is, a paſſage from death to life; or a mutation from a dead condition, into a living condition; the eſtate of ſin is a dead eſtate, yea, a deadly eſtate; and the ſtate of Grace, is a living eſtate, yea, a lively eſtate. There any many Doctrinal Propoſitions, which are couched in theſe words: As 1. That an impenitent, or unconverted man, is a dead man: <hi>[This my Son was dead]</hi> 2. That when a ſinner is converted, he is then made a live: <hi>[And is alive]</hi> 3. That God doth ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a very great and notorious ſinner: <hi>[This, this my Son]</hi> 4. That great afflictions are ſometimes the means of a great ſinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: <hi>[This my Son was]</hi> 5. That there is an almighty power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to convert or change a ſinner [As much as to make a dead man to live.] 6. That true Converſion is a very great and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alteration: (No change is like that from death to life.) 7. That true Converſion is an inward, or a ſoul-alteration; not of cloaths, or painting: (It is the putting of life into a dead man.) 8. That a ſinner contributes nothing at all towards his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but Converſion of a ſinner, is the ſole work of a God; (for it is God only, who can quicken the dead, no dead man can make himſelf alive.) 9. That the Lord takes notice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition of man (of the <hi>Prodigals</hi> former condition, <hi>he was dead,</hi> and of his preſent condition, but <hi>he is alive again.)</hi> 10.

It is reported of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Philoſopher, that he fell into a Diſeaſe, which daſhed out all the Learning that ever he acquired, ſo that he forgat even his own Name. Original ſin is like the extinguiſhing of a Candle; the Candle remains ſtill, but the Light is gone: Or like the quenching of red Iron; the Iron remains, but the fiery redneſs is all gone: Or like a Tree, the Limbs remain, but the Life is gone. It is an Univerſal ſpoil; it hath robbed us of all our ſupernaturals; worſe to us than the Devil to <hi>Job,</hi> who took away all that he had, yet ſpared his Life: But Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin not onely took away Paradiſe and Righteouſneſs, but all ſelf-power ſo much as to deſire to be good. 2. <hi>A total depravation of all the man. Seges ubi Troia:</hi> The Soul of Man was once like a Garden, fully ſet with the ſweeteſt Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Righteouſneſs; but now it is become like a Wilderneſs run over and filled with Briars and Thorns: Or it is like a Face, which once was the moſt curious of features, (every part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing moſt amiable ſweetneſs;) now it is like the ſame Face, moſt deformed with the cluſters of the Pox, and the very ſhame and reproach of it ſelf. There is not a Faculty in the Soul, but it is like the Bough of a fruitfull Tree, thickly laden with Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: It is a Spring, bubling out nothing but averſation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, reſiſtance to ſpiritual good; and readineſs, inclination, eagerneſs, unſatiableneſs to all that is evil: <hi>God ſaw that every imagination of the thoughts of the heart of man was onely evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5.

By all this (I think) it manifectly appears, That the unconverted man is ſpiritually dead, becauſe Original Sin reigns in him; (if in any, then in him;) and where Original Sin reigns, there is a total privation or abſence of all ſpiritual Life, and total corruption or preſence of ſpiritual Death in the Soul. <note place="margin">The terms uſed in Scripture to expreſs conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>

A wounded man is in a tedious condition, and a diſeaſed man is in a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; but what is a wound to death? what is a diſeaſe to death? <hi>Me morienti mori;</hi> Death is the Sun-ſet of all comfort; Death is the drowning of a little world; Death is the very Hermitage of forgetfulneſs and loathſome corruption: Death is the loweſt and vileſt condition; what then is a ſpiritual Death? No Death like the ſpiritual Death. O my friends, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſpiritual Death, either in compariſon, in its proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, <note place="margin">Conſider this death.</note> or in the conſequents of it, ſurely, no Death, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſo diſmal as it. 1. <hi>In compariſon with any other</hi>

                  <hi>Death:</hi> This is the worſt, this is the heavieſt. There is the Death of our <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> (into which <hi>Job</hi> fell;) of our <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> (into which <hi>David</hi> fell;) of our <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>natural Life,</hi> (into which <hi>Lazarus</hi> fell;) of the <hi>Soul,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul of man, into which every unconverted ſinner is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: Now what is a dead Eſtate to a dead Soul? Or what is a dead Name to a dead Soul? Or what is a dead Body to a dead Soul? It is not ſo much as the death of a Dog to the death of a Man. Every unconverted man hath a dead ſoul; a converted man may have a troubled ſoul, but the unconverted man hath a dead ſoul, ſin hath ſlain his precious ſoul; If the ſoul be dead, what is alive? What is that man whoſe ſoul is dead? In all other deaths, ſomething is alive; if Goods be gone, the Name lives; if the Name be gone, the Body lives; if the Body be gone, the Soul lives: But if the Soul alſo be gone, what lives? 2. <hi>In it ſelf:</hi> Why ſpiritual Death is a total privation of God, <note place="margin">In i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted mans dead ſoul is filled with living ſins, as a good mans ſoul is filled with dying and dead ſins; and a ſoul full of living ſins, is much like a ſoul filled up with Hel-fire. There is no evil ſo evil as ſin, and no ſin ſo evil as living ſin, and no living ſin ſo evil as a fulneſs and an onlineſs of living ſin. 3. <hi>In the conſequents of it:</hi> I will name but three of them, <note place="margin">In the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it.</note> 1.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſenſibleneſs:</hi> Where there is no life, there is no ſenſe; of all ſinners, the unſenſible ſinner is in the moſt deadly condition. <hi>Tanto pejor quanto inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibiliter,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Do what you will to a dead man, he is <note place="margin">Unſenſibleneſs.</note> unſenſible of it; call to him, he hears not; put the ſweeteſt perfumes to him, he ſmels not; kick him, cut him, burn him, he feels not; although he be full of loathſomneſs, he perceives it not. Now I beſeech you mind this Trial; for verily, if ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual unſenſibleneſs prevail upon you, you are ſpiritually dead: If ſpiritual ſenſe be the firſt evidence of Life, then <hi>è contra,</hi> ſpiritual unſenſibleneſs is a ſure evidence of Death: And what ſpiritual ſenſation is yet wrought in you? There are ſins upon ſins (mountains upon mountains) in your hearts, the leaſt of them hath been an heavy burthen to a living ſoul, but what haſt thou ever felt of thy ſinfull heart and life? There is in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel, no leſs than riches of Mercy, freeneſs of Love, glories of Heaven tendred to you; but what do you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in it? Didſt thou never yet feel and cry out of a body of Death? O here, here is a dead heart, an ignorant heart, a proud heart, an unbelieving heart, an heart in which there is no good, in which is all evil. Ah poor man, thou art a dead man; no feeling, no complaining, no crying out of thy heart againſt all thoſe many many vile and notorious ſins.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>An univerſal and conſtant coldneſs.</hi> If life be gone, heat is gone; the Feet are cold, and the Hands are cold, and the whole <note place="margin">An univerſal and conſtant coldneſs.</note> Body is cold, and the very Heart is cold too: A living man may have cold hands and feet, but he never hath a cold heart; for life is there, and heat is there. Why! there is no one converted man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, but he hath ſome heat in him; though not much in ſome of his actions, yet certainly ſome in his heart: O, ſaith he, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what is good, and I would do good, and I delight in the Law of God after the inward man; I believe, Lord help my unbelief. But now, an unconverted man hath, 1. <hi>A cold heart unto any ſpiritual good.</hi> Suppoſe he be at Prayer, and at Sermon; why! but he hath no heart to or in theſe duties, he hath no mind to theſe works, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115664:136"/> in them, or in the Sabbath, or in a Faſt; and though his body be preſent, yet his heart is afar off, it goes after his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs. 2. And this <hi>Coldneſs is univerſal:</hi> There is not any one ſpiritual Duty, unto which his heart is not dead or cold. He will tell you when he hears Catechizing, I ſhould like Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and ſo when he hears Preaching, I could like Praying; and ſo when Praying comes, I could like Reading; and when Reading comes, I could like Meditating; and when that comes, I could like Practiſing; and when Practiſing comes, I could like Underſtanding: But he diſſembles, he loves not one Duty at all; his heart to theſe is like a ſick ſtomack, that ſeems to like any thing but what it hath, but indeed likes no meat. 3. <hi>And it is alſo conſtant:</hi> I confeſs, even a good and converted heart may find ſometimes more actual indiſpoſitions to good than at other times, and ſometimes a greater meaſure of dulneſs and deadneſs; but an heart conſtantly cold, from one end of the year to another, all the life long, ſtill to loath ſpiritual ſervices, never to attain unto a delightfull and affectionate communion with God, This is a Token of a dead ſoul.</p>

The Goſpel is the great Trumpet of Chriſt, the Silver Trumpet by which he raiſeth the dead; as, at the laſt, he ſhall raiſe the dead by the Voice of the Trumpet; this is that by which Jeſus Chriſt quickens and pulls a ſoul out of its ſinfull condition. 1. It lets in light to ſee that condition: 2. It affects Conſcience to feel it: 3. It puts in Faith to go to Chriſt to fetch life: Yet many men are not wrought on at all by the Goſpel preached: Unmoveableneſs is the token of a dead man.</p>

               <p>The laſt Uſe ſhall be for <hi>Inſtruction</hi> unto ſeveral Duties. I will but glance a them. 1. <hi>Have as little ſociety with wicked men</hi>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Inſtruction. Have as little ſociety with unconverted men as may be.</note> 
                  <hi>as may be;</hi> for they are dead men: Would any man living have a dead man to be his companion? There is a two-fold Society with men: 1. One is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in reſpect of our Relations, or of our Commerce and Trade, which cannot well be avoided: 2. Another is <hi>arbitrary,</hi> in reſpect of our Election; avoid this, do not make choice of wicked ſociety. There are two Reaſons to hearken to this advice: One is, <hi>You ſhall never get any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good by their ſociety;</hi> a wicked man is an unprofitable man; Can any one gather Figs of Thorns, or Grapes of Thiſtles? Who is the better for a dead man? Another is, <hi>You ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much hurt by ſuch ſociety:</hi> The Jews were unclean, if they did but touch a dead body. It was the practice of a Tyrant once, to tie a dead man to a living man, that the filthy ſavour of the dead man might infect and deſtroy the life of the living man. O you who are to marry your children, take heed of marrying them to the dead; and you who are Free-men, take heed of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing ſociety with the dead. There are three notorious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs will enſue hereupon: 1. <hi>Dead ſociety will, by degrees, bring you into a deadneſs of heart;</hi> wicked company will certainly abate your zeal and holy affections, as waters do the flaming fire: 2. <hi>Dead ſociety will quench your Life in ſpiritual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> they will not onely interrupt, but mitigate your ſweet and wonted ſociety with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and good men: 3. <hi>Dead ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety will, in time, corrupt you to dead works:</hi> Remember <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">Lament thy unconverted friends.</note> You read that <hi>David</hi> wept for <hi>Abſalom, O Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon,</hi> &amp;c. and you read, that Chriſt wept for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> being
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115664:137"/> dead; and you read, of both of theſe weeping alſo for thoſe that were ſpiritually dead: <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy Law. Chriſt</hi> came near to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>wept over it, ſaying, Oh if thou hadſt known, even thou, at the leaſt in,</hi> &amp;c. Wouldſt not thou weep to ſee thy Fathers, or Mothers, or Siſters, or Brothers dead body carrying out to the grave? and ſay, <hi>Alas my Father, alas my Brother,</hi> alas my Child? How then canſt thou refrain tears for their dead ſouls? Why doeſt not thou pity the dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſoul of thy Father? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At a Funeral Feaſt, there is no mirth, becauſe the Maſter of the houſe is dead: Ah, weep over thy Father, over thy Son; the Maſter of the houſe is dead, his precious ſoul is dead: Thy pity can do a dead body no good, but it may do a dead ſoul ſome good, eſpecially, if you take in the next Duty, which is,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Pray for the dead:</hi> I mean not in the Popiſh ſenſe; they, <note place="margin">Pray for the Dead.</note> you know, pray for ſouls departed, ſuppoſing them to be in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, where the pains, as they ſay, are intollerable, equal to them in Hell, and the ſouls are deprived of the viſion of God; and therefore their Prieſts and others often pray for them; and upon the Graves they inſcribe, Pray for the ſoul of ſuch a one, and on his ſoul Jeſu have mercy: But this is a wicked ſuperſtition. We acknowledge no Purgatory, and no need of Prayers for ſouls departed, yet we hold Prayers requiſite for one another, whiles we are upon the earth. And becauſe ſome are dead whiles they live, O pray to the Lord for them; Lord Jeſu, have mercy upon the ſoul of my Husband, Child, Wife; O convert them, quicken them from the dead, ſuffer them not, their poor ſouls, to die for ever. When <hi>Steven</hi> was to die, he prayed for thoſe that were ſpiritually dead: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was dying, he alſo prayed for them: And <hi>Monica,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> prayed for him; and all of them were heard. <hi>Object.</hi> But I have prayed, but yet no good comes of it. <hi>Sol.</hi> Pray ſtill; as long as there is life, and as long as there is prayer, there is hope: It will be an excellent comfort to thee, and eternal happineſs to thy friend, if thou canſt, at length, by thy prayers, prevail with God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that one ſoul from death. <note place="margin">Uſe the means by w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Object.</hi> Why! but this is ridiculous, to bid a dead man do work, go, ſtir, do any thing. <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, 1. There is a difference twixt a man corporally dead, and a man ſpiritually dead: The former can do no action whatſoever, neither ſpiritual, nor civil, nor natural; the latter, though he can do nothing in ſpirituals, yet for the other, he may, and can. 2. You muſt diſtinguiſh twixt a ſpiritual action, and an action which brings to a ſpiritual means: He cannot convert his own heart, yet he hath power to hear the Word, which can. 'Tis true, that a wicked unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man cannot exert any one ſpiritual action; nevertheleſs, he hath liberty and power to go to Church, and hear a Sermon: Why! uſe this power, and this liberty, to come to the <hi>Pool where the Angel ſtirs;</hi> to come to the Ordinances, where God is pleaſed to quicken and raiſe the dead. 3. When thou art under a ſpiritual Ordinance, thou art under the voice of Chriſt himſelf, who hath ſaid, That <hi>the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and live.</hi> And truly, let me tell thee, That the Voice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Word, hath not only a power to find a loſt man, but alſo to quicken a dead man.</p>

There is the <hi>Life of Grace,</hi> which they enjoy in this world: 2. There is <hi>the Life of Glory,</hi> which they enjoy in the world to come, called often in Scripture, <hi>eternal life.</hi> The Text ſpeaks of the firſt of theſe; The <note place="margin">The life of Grace, is The life of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</note> converted ſinner is inveſted with the Life of Grace: And this again is branched into the life of, 1. <hi>Juſtification;</hi> for when a ſinner is juſtified, he is then in the condition of life: The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified man is a dead man, (for he lies under the ſentence of death;) and the juſtified man is a living man, he is paſſed from death to life; the Lord takes off the ſentence of eternal death from him; He ſhall not die for the ſins which he hath committed, for I have pardoned all his ſins, and now he ſhall live, and not die, ſaith the Lord. 2. <hi>Sanctification:</hi> When a ſinner is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

This Life is conſiderable, 1. <hi>In the Cauſe of it,</hi> which is no other but the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, who unites Chriſt and the Soul together; and upon this union, the Soul is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the life of Chriſt. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115664:138"/> Gal. 2. 20. 2. In the Nature of it;</hi> it is a <hi>novum &amp; ſpirituale eſſe,</hi> which doth regenerate the man, and, as it were, create him <note place="margin">In the nature of it.</note> again. The Scripture ſtiles this quality, <hi>a new creature,</hi> and <hi>the new man:</hi> It is an holy living principle. In a word, this life is nothing elſe but the Grace of the Spirit, regenerating, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the whole ſoul of a ſinner. It is ſaving light ſet up in the Mind, and ſaving wiſdome ſet up in the Judgment, and ſaving grace ſet up in the Will and Affections, which alter the old ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nature in man, and are a new ſpiritual inclination to matters that are ſpiritual, yea, and a new ſpiritual ability or power in the whole ſoul of man to work that is ſpiritual: Whereas the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding could not know the things of God, now it is enabled to know them, and to admire them, and to ſtudy them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Will was both unable to good, and unwilling to good, and only ſet on what was evil; now, being quickned by Grace, it is drawn off from that affectionate inclination to evil, and it is bent and inclined, and in ſome meaſure enabled to deſire Chriſt, to love Jeſus Chriſt, to fear God, to obey God, and to walk with God: And when this comes into the heart of a ſinner, he is ſaid to be alive again.</p>
               <p>Shall I draw out my thoughts of this Subject more clearly unto <note place="margin">When a ſinner is made alive. Jeſus Chriſt applies himſelf unto the ſoul, and breaths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the breath of life.</note> you? Take me then thus. When any ſinner is made ſpiritually alive, 1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt applies himſelf to the Soul, and he breaths into it the Spirit of Life.</hi> He doth with a poor dead ſoul, much like as <hi>Eliah</hi> did with the <hi>Shunamites dead child;</hi> who lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon the childs mouth, and his eyes upon the childs eyes, and his hands upon the childs hands; and he ſtretched himſelf upon the child, and the fleſh of the child waxed warm: So the Lord Jeſus applies himſelf by his Spirit to the ſoul of a ſinner, (to all the ſoul of a ſinner,) and works mightily in it, producing knowledge in a blind mind, and feeling in an hard heart, and faith in an unbelieving ſpirit, and all his Graces in the whole Soul. 2. <hi>Which gracious principles</hi>

                  <hi>are all of them living principles;</hi> and alter all the ſoul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it ſpiritually: So that the man who cared not for God, nor Chriſt, nor Grace, nor holy Duties heretofore; now his ſoul bends to theſe, and he minds theſe, and he is never better than when he is thinking of God, and mourning for his ſins, and thirſting for Chriſt, and praying to God, and hearing of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115664:139"/> Word of God; this is his deſire, and this is his delight. 3. <hi>There is a power in theſe principles of ſpiritual life.</hi> A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">There is power of ſpiritual life in theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> againſt his ſins; ſo that now he can hate them, and ſay, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols? Get ye hence.</hi> And a power in his affections; ſo that now he is able to love God above all, and able to fear God, and not diſpleaſe him willingly. And a power in his will; ſo that now he is able to come to Chriſt, and cleave to Chriſt, as his onely happineſs. And a power to ſpiritual actions; ſo that he is now able to hear and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, to pray and wreſtle, to pray and believe, to believe and repent.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>You have enjoyed the means of Life,</hi> The Goſpel is often <note place="margin">You have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied the means of life.</note> called, the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> a quickning and regenerating Word; it carries Chriſt in it, the Author of Life; and the Apoſtle calls it, the <hi>Miniſtration of Life:</hi> And perhaps it hath been ſo to ſome poor man and woman, and to ſome of thy children. But O how long haſt thou heard it? how often haſt thou come to this Bread of Life? to theſe Waters of Life? What! and yet dead in thy ſins? not yet quickned and made alive? Why! thou art a reproach to the Goſpel; and thy ſins have not only given, death to thy ſoul, but death to the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Goſpel is made by them a dead Letter; it is not ſo in it ſelf, but thou haſt made it ſo: And how wilt thou anſwer God, for killing thy ſoul, and killing his Chriſt, and killing his Goſpel?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Many have a name that they live, but</hi> (like the Angel of <note place="margin">Many have a name to live, and yet are dead.</note> the Church of <hi>Sardis) they are dead,</hi> Revel. 3. 1. Oh Sirs! Spiritual life, (the life of grace,) is a rare thing, and a difficult thing. Every man loves his life, but few love this life: No man hates his own life (almoſt,) but moſt men hate this life of grace, becauſe it is deſtructive to this life of ſin: And many think they have it, and others think ſo too, and yet they have it not. You know, it is one thing to put Flowers upon a dead body, and another thing to put life into a dead man: It is one thing for the Sun to convey light, another thing for the Sun to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey life.

O therefore, look to it, that you have more than a name of life; that you live indeed.</p>

That when they come to be truly ſenſible of their hearts and ways, then their ſins appear exceeding great, and the mercy and grace of God ſeem little; O! they have withſtood the offers of grace, and all ſelf-power is gone, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſinning is an abſolute bar to their converſion.</p>
               <p>And there are eight Reaſons, why a man (made ſenſible of <note place="margin">Reaſons why a man ſenſible of his great ſin, thinks God will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him.</note> his great ſinnings) inclines to think that God will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him. 1. <hi>Becauſe he hath been one who hath exceedingly provoked God to wrath againſt him:</hi> He ſees great wrath in God, and that he hath, by his continual ſinnings, incenſed the Lord.

Now when a man feels wrath, 'tis an hard thing to perſwade him, that God hath any thoughts and intentions of mercy and grace for him. 4. <hi>Such a perſon ordinarily looks more upon the examples of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, than upon the inſtances of converſion;</hi> rather what God hath done againſt them, than for any of them.

If I had neglected it only, but I have rejected it; I have been ſo long unwilling, deſpiſing, will Grace be pleaſed and ſo willing to one ſo unwilling? Grace will not be willing to ſmile on him who hath frowned on it; Grace will not ſtoop to him who hath trampled upon Grace: Can Divine Grace and I be ſo eaſily friends! What, forty years lying in Hell, and now to think I ſhall go to Heaven! all my life to ſerve the Devil, and yet now to think that God will take me, or make me his ſervant! 7. <hi>Such a man ſees his ſins in another manner than ever before:</hi> The face of ſin is unvailed, like ſo many ſpears in the heart of Chriſt, like ſo many wounds given to ſweeteſt Mercy, like ſo many cups of poyſon that he hath drunk, and ſo many cups of wrath which he hath made Chriſt to drink, and as ſo much dung caſt upon the Beauties of Holineſs. 8. <hi>Yea, and he feels his ſins in another manner.</hi> O, ſaith he, I feel my proud heart ſtill, and my adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous heart ſtill, and my covetous heart ſtill; and when any good ariſeth, it is ſurprized, it it reſiſted, it is quenched by a thouſand evil motions: And though I hear, and though I ſeek God, yet it is thus with me.

                  <hi>that God hath not hitherto converted him; yet no ſinner</hi> (living under the means of Grace) <hi>can ſafely ſay, that God will never convert him:</hi> For no ſinner can know his eternal Reprobation, this is a ſecret counſel which is reſerved in the boſome of God; can know the ſeaſon, the very deſigned ſeaſon when God will convert him; for the Lord reſerves the power of converſion, and the ſeaſon of converſion to himſelf; he converts ſome at one time, ſome at another: God never revealed to any man, that at ſuch a time, at ſuch an hour he would convert him; <hi>Conſequenter,</hi> a man may know the hour of his converſion, but <hi>Antecedenter,</hi> he could not know that God would then (juſt then) convert him. 5. <hi>There is more probability that God will convert thee (thus ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115664:149"/> comes off with the ſharper converſion.</hi> The great Malefactor ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath his Book and his Life too, but he is burned in the Hand, and in the Shoulder. <hi>Paul</hi> was a great ſinner, and was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but his great ſins, which were a troubling to Chriſt, did prove a trembling to his heart. God puts ſuch a ſinner upon the Rack; he ſtrikes and wounds him, that all the Countrey ſhall hear of the troubles which his Conſcience feels for his ſinnings againſt God: God doth, as it were, ſinge him with the flames of Hell, before he meets him with the kiſſes of Heaven. 4. <hi>Moſt uſually, thoſe great and notorious ſinners whom God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, are ſuch who have thus ſinned under their ignorance. I was a blaſphemer,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Paul, but I did obtain mercy, for I did it ignorantly, and through misbelief.</hi> He did not know what he did, he thought he had been in the right: You ſeldome read of one knowing Phariſee, who perſecuted Chriſt, that was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet you read of many of the Jews, and of the Elders, that were converted; for they did not know Jeſus Chriſt to be the Lord of Glory. I will not ſay, that no knowingly notorious ſinner ſhall ever be converted; but certainly, Converſion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare, where Knowledge holds the Candle to long and great works of Darkneſs.

                  <hi>a great ſinner.</hi> There are two ſorts of afflictions, 1. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> which ſet upon the conſcience; theſe are ſometimes an occaſion of Converſion: A troubled conſcience doth many times end in a renewed conſcience; troubles of heart are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſed with change of heart. The great ſtorms occaſion the Traveller to come in for ſhelter: <hi>The biting Serpents</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the <hi>Iſraelites to look to the braſen Serpent;</hi> the <hi>avenger</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> made the guilty perſon to <hi>flye to the City of refuge;</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning conſcience oftentimes makes a poor troubled Soul to come in unto Jeſus Chriſt for eaſe and reſt. 2. <hi>Outward,</hi> which light upon the body and eſtate of a ſinner; theſe alſo ſometimes ſerve to fetch in a ſinner; as he once ſaid, <hi>periiſſem niſi periiſſem,</hi> I had periſhed unleſs I had periſhed. <hi>Joſephs brethren</hi> had never found <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and craved food of him, unleſs a famine had befallen them. If God had not deprived ſome men of their wordly goods, they had never come in to ſeek heavenly Treaſures: We may ſay of them that if they had been fed, they had been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and if they had not been famiſhed, they had never been fed with the bread of life.</p>
               <p>Again, theſe outward afflictions may be conſidered two wayes, either 1. <hi>Simply,</hi> and nakedly in themſelves; ſo they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert any ſinner, no more then the <hi>pool of Betheſda</hi> (alone) could heale a diſeaſed Perſon, or <hi>Elijahs ſalt could heal the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2.

                  </gap>t. Afflictions in themſelves are privations of a comfortable good; but if God ſanctifies them, they may then be a means of our everlaſting good: God can uſe them as a bridle, not only to ſtop us running out of the way, but alſo to turn us into the right way. <hi>Hoſ. 2. 14.

See 2 <hi>Chro. 33. 11. The Lord brought upon him the captains of the hoſt of the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>who took</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>among the Thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carryed him to</hi> Babylon. v. 12. <hi>And when he was in affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf greatly. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a proud and lofty ſinner, and therefore God puld him down; <hi>he did drive him from men, and he did eat Graſs as Oxen, and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven;</hi> and having thus abaſed him, he wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to acknowledg and praiſe the true God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may it appear that, <hi>&amp;c. Sol.</hi> There are four <note place="margin">How this may appear. Afflictions ſanctifyed are the ſouls Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glaſſes.</note> things attending upon ſanctifyed afflictions, and all of them contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Converſion. 1. <hi>Afflictions (ſanctifyed) are the ſouls Looking-Glaſs,</hi> wherein a man may ſee his ſins, which are the cauſes of afflictions; there are divers Glaſſes in which we may ſee the face of our ſins. 1. The Glaſs of the Word. 2. The Glaſs of Reproof. 3. The Glaſs of Conſcience. 4. The Glaſs of Afflictions: Affliction is a Glaſs wherein a perſon firſt <hi>ſees his own ſins; Ocules quam culpa claudit pena a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit. We were verily guilty of the blood of our brother</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren;) <hi>and as I have ſerved others, ſo the Lord hath ſerved me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Adonibezeck,) 2. Sees them as ſinners.</hi> In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity we ſee the pleaſures of ſin, but in adverſity the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin; in the one we ſee them as our friends, in the other as our enemies: <hi>An evil and bitter thing that we have forſaken the Lord</hi> (ſo <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaketh.) 3. <hi>Sees them with a ſerious
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115664:150"/> look;</hi> ſees them, and thinks of them; ſees them, and layes them to heart: <hi>Thy wickedneſs hath procured theſe things unto thee.</hi> Now when a perſon is brought to a right ſight of ſin, to ſee his own ſins, and as ſins, and ſeriouſly conſiders of them; this is a way tending to his Converſion: <hi>I conſidered my wayes</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Afflictions (ſanctifyed) work much upon the Conſcience;</hi> they are the rods of God upon the Soul; they are the Waters of <note place="margin">They work much upon the conſcience.</note> 
                  <hi>Marah,</hi> bitter Waters, and they ſtir up conſcience to ſpeak bitter words unto us: Theſe were thy wayes, and theſe were thy doings; thou wouldſt not be warned, thou wouldſt not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and now ſee whither thy ſins do tend, now ſee into what ſtraits they have brought thee, now thou wilt believe that God is diſpleaſed with thee: When conſcience is ſtirred, when the burden of afflictions turn into the burden of conſcience, two things ordinarily enſue thereupon. 1. <hi>A mans carnal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is broken:</hi> The man thought himſelf ſafe and ſecure before; but now he ſees his condition to be very ſad, unſound, unſafe, and miſerable; not only my goods are gone, but my God alſo is gone. 2. <hi>The heart comes to be humbled:</hi> O, A working conſcience, a ſmiting conſcience is the Hammer of God, by which he breaks and bows the ſoul. Afflictions now ſtir up the Gall and the Wormwood, and the ſoul is humbled by them; and when the ſoul is brought to ſee ſin, and to conſider of ſin, and to be humbled for ſin, it is now in a fair way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Afflictions (if ſanctifyed) are gales to Prayer: Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee; they powred out a Prayer, when</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">They are gales to Prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>thy chaſtening was upon them,</hi> Iſai. 26. 10. <hi>In their afflictions, they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſea 5. It is almoſt natural for an afflicted man to pray, and afflictions put an edge of zeal on Prayer; we are ſeldome more frequent and more fervent in that duty, then in the times of our diſtreſs. But then obſerve, that as afflictions are apt to quicken prayer; ſo if they have occaſioned a ſenſe and trouble in the heart for ſin, Then 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually they ſtir up Prayer for pardon of ſin,</hi> and for converſion from ſin. <hi>Blot out my tranſgreſſions,</hi> praies afflicted <hi>David. Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> praies diſtreſſed <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31. 18 Theſe are the two great deſires of a diſtreſſed ſoul. 2. <hi>Uſually God
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115664:151"/> hears theſe Prayers, The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe,</hi> Pſ. 51. 17. A poor ſinner cannot put up a more acceptable requeſt unto God then this: Lord, I beſeech thee, change and turn my heart, ſubdue mine iniquities! let not ſin have dominion over me! I beſeech thee, ſuffer me not to diſhonour thee any more! So that now you ſee that afflictions have brought the Soul and God together; the afflicted Perſon ſees a need of Mercy and Grace, and unto God he applies himſelf who is the only Author of a ſinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the only Phyſician of a ſinful ſoul.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Afflictions (if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſanctifyed) incline us unto converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:</hi>

Oh, what a Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and authority hath the Word over ſuch a man? he can be content to have his ſins ript open, and he can hear and weep, Oh, a ſinner! and he longs to hear of ſome word of hope, and when he hears it, Oh, how good is God! and he catcheth greedily at the word of direction; and when he hears it, Oh, when ſhall I be this! when ſhall I do this! Lord, give grace, give ſtrength unto thy poor ſervant; the man in his proſperity would not know the Lord, nor hearken to him; he was above counſel and inſtruction, but now his <hi>ear is opened to diſcipline, and inſtruction is ſealed unto him,</hi> Job 33. 16.

               <p>I now proceed to another Propoſition, which is implyed in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there is an Almighty Power required to convert or change a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. There is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power required to convert a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinner,</hi> no leſs then is requiſite to quicken a dead man: (This my Son was dead, and is alive again;) To awaken a man out of ſleep, needs no great power; (a word, a call, a cry, a little ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may do it;) but to quicken a dead man, here calls, and cries, and ſtirrings will not do it, all the power of Men and Angels will not do it. In <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. you read of <hi>three thouſand converted at one Sermon.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 4. of <hi>five thouſand converted at another Sermon,</hi> ſo many, ſo quickly converted; certainly the Power that wrought this muſt be Almighty. Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt come, and he muſt cry, and he muſt <hi>cry with a loud voice;</hi> Lazarus, <hi>come forth,</hi> Joh. 11. 43. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>exceeding greatneſs of Gods Power, towards them that believe, and of the working of his mighty Power,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 19. <hi>Even ſuch a Power as God wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead,</hi> v. 20.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold opinion about the power which is put forth <note place="margin">The power put forth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Not moral on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> in a ſinners Converſion. 1. Some hold it to be <hi>Moral only,</hi> becauſe this is moſt congruous to the will of man, which is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubject. God (they imagine) doth offer and propound ſuch Objects, with ſuch Arguments which do wooe, and allure, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the will of a ſinner. <hi>Sol.</hi> It is true that the outward means work only after a moral way. The word (which is the miniſtry for Converſion) it doth offer to the ſinner Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, and death; It reveales, and commands, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth and threatneth: But a moral ſuaſion (as they call it) is not ſufficient to convert: And there are four Reaſons which to me ſeem very ſtrong and unanſwerable againſt it, 1. <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Proved.</note> 
                  <hi>very Phraſes by which a ſinners Converſion is expreſſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, do ſurmount a moral ſuaſion:</hi> There is no leſs power to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115664:152"/> convert a ſinner then there was 1. To create man at the firſt. 2. There ſhall be to raiſe the dead at the laſt; when a ſinner is converted, he is ſaid to be created again, to be born again, to be regenerated; his heart is ſaid to be opened, and circumciſed; his ſtrong heart is taken away, an heart of fleſh is given unto him; ſurely all this is more then a moral power. 2. <hi>This moral ſuaſion muſt neceſſarily preſuppoſe ſome power and abilities in him with whom it deals;</hi> as if you counſel a man, you ſuppoſe ſomething in him to incline him to hearken; if you do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a power, then it muſt be ſuppoſed that your counſel is in vain; as if you ſhould counſel an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> to change his skin, or a blind man to ſee; this were in vain, for there is no power in them to do theſe. 3. <hi>The converſion of a ſinner in reſpect of God ſhould be then contingent;</hi> It might be, and it might not be; Though God intends to convert a man, yet he may fail and miſs of the event, for as much as a moral work is reſiſtable, and may eaſily be put by. <hi>How often would I have gathered your children, and you would not; yee alwayes reſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt. 4. Yea, the Converſion of a ſinner ſhould in the event depend more upon the will of man, then on the will of God.</hi> The grace offered is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and it is made peculiar, and differential by mans will; the right uſe of grace is not of grace, but of free will; ſo that <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimen ſiliorum Dei &amp; ſeculi,</hi> is <hi>a natura,</hi> not <hi>ex gratia.</hi> The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſuaſion is preſented unto two ſinners, the ſuaſion is alike; why doth it bring this man and not the other man to Converſion? There can be no reaſon given but this, that the one would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it, the other would not; ſo that the effect of Converſion (by this opinion) is manifeſtly placed in the liberty of a ſinners will, whereas the Scripture plainly aſcribes it to the will of him who calls, not to the will of him who is called. 2. Others hold it to be much beyond this; <hi>To be a moſt High Power, a</hi>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115664:153"/> man; they are no weak weapons, but mighty weapons; and mighty through God, which muſt pull down theſe ſtrong holds; <hi>the heart of man is full of evil,</hi> ſaith Solomon; <hi>it is deſperately wicked,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremy:</hi> I beſeech you pauſe a while upon two Conſiderations. 1. <hi>There is an exceeding ſtrength in Sin, even in the Regenerate, and converted Perſon: Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>I am ſold,</hi> I <hi>am led captive. David</hi> is weeping for no leſs ſins then of <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Murder: Peter</hi> weeps bitterly for no leſs ſin then <hi>denying of Chriſt,</hi> then for ſwearing and curſing. In the very beſt <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit; So that they cannot do the Good they would,</hi> and cannot overcome the evil that they hate. Now mark, if there be ſo much ſtrength in ſinful nature dying, how great is the ſtrength in ſinful nature living? If there be ſo much power in a broken arm, how great is the power in a perfect, ſtrong unbroken arm? If all the Chriſtians Grace he hath be ſometimes too weak for his ſinful inclination, aſſuredly then all external counſels, adviſes, reproofs are too weak to alter the whole ſinful nature; for the quality of <hi>Grace</hi> is much more ſtrong, then the exhortation unto Grace.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>there is ſuch a ſtrength in ſin, that all the degrees of Grace unto which a converted perſon can poſſible attain in this life, are not able totally to rid the ſoul of it.</hi> Till the mud-wall be quite pulled down, ſome of the Ivy will ſtick unto it; <hi>Jacob</hi> went hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto his grave. Till death makes an end of our lives, Grace cannot make an end of our ſins. Is it thus with the converted perſon, that neither Counſels, nor Exhortations, nor Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived can utterly extirpate ſin? nay is ſometimes too weak for ſin? verily then there can be no converſion of a ſinner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Almighty power: the power of ſin in an unconverted man being in fulleſt ſtrength, in every faculty and making higheſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to Grace, becauſe naturally of deepeſt contrariety thereunto.</p>
               <p>3. Nay thirdly, conſider as there is a mighty ſtrength <note place="margin">From that ſtrength joyned with Sin, to oppoſe the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in ſin, ſo <hi>there is a mighty ſtrength joyned with ſin, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſinners Converſion;</hi> and the ſinner cannot be converted until both theſe armies be conquered: 1. <hi>Satans ſtrength</hi> is joyned with the ſtrength of ſin: the ſinner is under the dominion of ſin, and he is likewiſe under the dominion of Satan; and as ſin is a powerful Lord, ſo Satan is a powerful Prince; he is the <hi>God of this world, he works mightily in the Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:115664:154"/> Epheſ. 2. 2. He takes them captive at his pleaſure; and as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> raiſed all his hoſt, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo doth Satan ſtir up all his policy, and put forth all his power, to withhold a perſon from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. He arms the Judgment with reaſons, exceptions, ſhifts, diſputes; and he arms the Will with averſneſs, unreaſonableneſs, ſtubbornneſs, pride; And he arms the Conſcience, and he arms the Affections. O what corrupt reaſonings? how many proud denials? what hideous repreſentations of the wayes of Grace? what delights, what profits we have had by ſin? what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, what diſputes, what feares, what terrors, what dampings of the Word, what diſtractions in Prayer, what agonies, and continual, and vehement, and violent conflicts, doubts, ſcruples, &amp;c? 2 <hi>All theſe muſt be anſwered,</hi> and all theſe muſt be conquered, if the ſoul be converted. And can all this be done by a morall power? O no; it muſt be an Almighty power, which muſt reſcue a poor ſoul out of the hands of two ſuch mighty Lords. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not be delivered from one King, and with a temporal deliverance, but by the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greatneſs of Gods power, and by an high and inſuperable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of divine Grace. 4.

None but the <hi>God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, can inlighten the eyes of the Epheſians,</hi> c. 1. 17, 18. Surely then, none leſs then he can open the heart of the Epheſians; for which is the greater work, to open an eye, or to open an heart? Is it not more to give life to the dead, then to give ſight to the blinde? None but God can make a ſinner ſenſible of his ſins; <hi>When the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. Now which is the greater work, to make me feel my ſins, or to make me forſake my ſins? to trouble my heart, or to alter my heart? to feel my diſeaſe, or to heale me of my diſeaſe? to ſhew me my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So ſay thou, O Lord, thou art the living God, thou only art the Lord of life, I come to thee to convert mee unto thee; I hear, I read, I confer, I meditate on arguments, I purpoſe, and yet I am not converted; Miniſters deal with me, and Friends deal with me, and Mercies deal with me, and Afflictions deal with me, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances deal with me, and yet I am not converted!

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. True conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a change, a great, inward, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Change. It is a Change.</note> 
                  <hi>and univerſal change.</hi> You plainly ſee four things in this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which offer themſelves to our conſideration. 1. True Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a <hi>change; (was dead and is alive;)</hi> certainly here is a change. <hi>Ego ſum ego,</hi> ſaid the Harlot, here was no Converſion. <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> anſwered the young man; here was converſion, for here was a change; There may be a <hi>was,</hi> and an <hi>is,</hi> without a change. Chriſt was God, and is God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 8. And in many men the <hi>was,</hi> and the <hi>is,</hi> are without a change; They were ignorant, and are ignorant ſtill; they were filthy, and are filthy ſtill; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. But if a man be converted, <hi>the was,</hi> and <hi>the is,</hi> are different, they are changed: <hi>I was a Perſecutor,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> but being converted he is not ſo; <hi>ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> of the Corinthians, <hi>but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified.</hi> Now when I ſay, that Converſion is a change, you muſt know that there is a two-fold Change: One is, <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> which alters the ſubſtance of man, as in Generation, and in Corruption, of which the Philoſophers ſpeak: Converſion is no ſuch change; the ſoul and body of a man remaines the ſelfe ſame ſubſtance before and after Converſion: It was the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> who Was a Perſecutor, and Is a Preacher of Chriſt: As in the Sacrament, it is the ſame Bread for ſubſtance after Conſecration, which it was before Conſecration; So is it the ſame man, for the Philoſophical ſubſtance, before and after converſion.</p>
               <p>Another is accidental, which alters the qualities of man. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was the ſame man when he was a Leper, and when he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his Leproſie; he was the ſame for ſubſtance, (of it there was no change,) but he was not the ſame for the accidental quality, (becauſe his leproſie was changed.) Such a change is there in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; the ſinfull Leproſie is changed, and a fair beautiful form of holineſs is put into his ſoul; the Glove is now perfumed, the bitter water is now ſeaſoned, another nature contrary to his former nature is now infuſed; <hi>old things are paſt away, all things are become new,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 17. Againe obſerve, that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental change, or alteration of a perſon, is likewiſe two-fold; 1. One is <hi>Corruptive,</hi> which is from good to evil; ſuch a change was there in the <hi>Angels that fell,</hi> (they fell from heaven to hell, from being Children of Light, to be the Princes of darkneſs)
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115664:157"/> and ſuch a change was there in <hi>Adam</hi> that fell. O what a change! what a ſudden loſs of great poſſeſſions, of unſpeakable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. O how good once he was, O what a ſinner now he is! 2. Another is <hi>perfective,</hi> which is from evil to Good: Such a change is Converſion: Why! it is from ſin to God: It is more then for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to leave the priſon and be made a Prince: when a man is converted, he is now raiſed and enabled with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and life, and excellencies of God and Chriſt; true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a perfecting change.</p>
               <p>One diſtinction more I cannot omit; It is this, The perfective change is likewiſe two-fold 1. <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>forinſecal,</hi> as in the Juſtification of a ſinner: when a ſinner is Juſtified, the ſtate of this ſinner is changed; before it he was in the ſtate of death and condemnation; after it he is in the ſtate of life and abſolution. 2. <hi>Inherent</hi> and <hi>intrinſecal;</hi> as here in the converſion of a ſinner, which is a change within a man; a change not ſo properly of his <hi>condition,</hi> as of his <hi>diſpoſition;</hi> even from one contrary to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that <hi>à Genere ad Genus,</hi> from one kind of quality to another kind. A ſinner hath ſometimes a contrary motion of good to evil put into him, but this is not Converſion; for it is not a mutation, but a motion: A ſinners inclination is ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, that he doth not ſin; yet this is not converſion, for it is a chaining only, not a changing of his diſpoſition; the Lyon is a Lyon in chains. A ſinner goes from one ſin to another; he leaveth his riotouſneſs, and turneth to coveteouſneſs; he leaveth profaneneſs, and turneth to hypocriſy; yet this is not Converſion, for his ſinful diſpoſition is not altered from kind to kind: It is but a ſhifting from one evil to another evil; as the wind from one poynt to another; it is not a change from evil to good. If a man could leave all the ſins in the world, and yet he loved and ſerved but one, this man is not a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, becauſe converſion is a change from one kind to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary kind, which the man comes ſhort of whoſe heart is ſtill ſet on any one ſin.</p>
               <p>2. True Converſion is <hi>a very great and notable Change;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is a very great and not able change.</note> there is no change, I think, in all the world of that height and depth as the converſion of a ſinner. No not that from Grace to Glory; becauſe it is but <hi>ab imperfecto,</hi> and this is <hi>à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trario.</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:115664:157"/> The Scripture doth frequently parallel it even with thoſe changes which are miraculous: When Chriſt made the <hi>blind to ſee,</hi> and the <hi>deaf to hear,</hi> and the <hi>dumb to ſpeak,</hi> and the <hi>dead to live,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſſeſſed Devils;</hi> theſe were very great and notable changes, take them ſingle and they were ſo. Now all theſe miracles are wrought in any one converted perſon; 'Tis called a <hi>Creation,</hi> a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe God puts out as much Power in the Converſion of a ſinner, as he did in creating the World. It is the prime work of the Spirit of Chriſt, the top, the very higheſt; when any one man is converted, the blind is made to ſee, and the deaf is made to hear: (Iſai. 29. 18. <hi>In that day ſhall the deaf hear the words of the Book, and the eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,)</hi> and the dumb is made to ſpeak, and the lame is made to leap: Iſai. 35. 5. <hi>The eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Then ſhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing:</hi> Yea, and the dead is made to live; <hi>[This my Son was dead, and is alive again;]</hi> and ſo many ſins as there are from which the heart is converted, of ſo many Devils is that heart diſpoſſeſſed; thy filthineſs was an unclean Devil, and thy perſecution was a raging Devil; every ſin that poſſeſſed thee was a ſtrong Devil within thee: Oh, what a great change is it to behold a ſtone turned into fleſh! and yet in Converſion, <hi>The heart of ſtone is turned into an heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. What a change were it to ſee a ſtone changed into a Son of <hi>Abraham!</hi> and yet in Converſion a ſtony hearted ſinner is changed into a Son of God; what a change were it to ſee darkneſs turned into light! yet in Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is ſo; <hi>Ye were once darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5. 8. What ſhall I ſay? in Converſion, the Bramble becomes a Fig Tree, and the Lion becomes a Lamb, and the Wilderneſs is turned into a Paradiſe, and Hell is turned into Heaven; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner turns liberal, ſo did <hi>Zacheus;</hi> the Perſecutor becomes a Martyr, ſo did <hi>Paul;</hi> the hideous ſinner become a Saint, ſo did <note place="margin">Four things ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There are four things which ſet out the greatneſs of the change in a ſinners Converſion. 1. <hi>There is a change of nature in nature;</hi> there is a man, and a man, in the ſame man; an old man, and a new man, in the ſame man; two judgments in one judgment, two wills in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115664:158"/> one will, like two Armies in one Field, or like the Twins in <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s Womb. 2. <hi>There is the ſtrangeſt unlikeneſs to a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This is in a moment.</note> 
                  <hi>mans ſelf in a moment that ever was;</hi> in a moment to hate Chriſt exceedingly, and the next moment to love Chriſt above all; to crucifie Chriſt becauſe he ſaid he was the Son of God, and preſently confeſs that he is the Son of God; to mock the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as drunkards, and preſently cry out, what ſhall we do? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this moment to love ſin, as if it were my only Heaven; and the next moment to loath ſin, as if it were my only Hell: Now to count all truth and holineſs, but as dung to the World; and preſently to count all the World but as dung to Grace and Chriſt. 3. <hi>There is the higheſt contrariety in actions and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that ever was;</hi> to ſee a man pull down what he built up, and <note place="margin">There is the higheſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of courſes and actions.</note> to build up what he pulled down; to be mad againſt Chriſt, and then preſently even beſides himſelf for Chriſt; to ſcourge and revile <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and preſently after, honour and embrace, and almoſt adore them: To reproach the Saints and their wayes, and ſuddenly to admire them, and value them and their paths, as worthieſt of our deareſt love and ſociety. 4. <hi>And a little,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">And a little grace to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all this.</note> 
                  <hi>very little Grace to produce all this:</hi> That one drop ſhould ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the great bitter Ocean; that one little ſpark ſhould cauſe all this flame; A very little Engine ſhould move all the World, and level the Mountains; a little Grace to enter the Throne, and to turn all the ſoul round about. That <hi>Moſes</hi> little <hi>Rod ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Sea,</hi> and melt the Rock; a little Ant tumble down a Mountain; that the <hi>Grain of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> which is the leaſt of ſeeds, ſhould grow into a Tree: That a very little Grace ſhould transform the moſt rebellious heart, humble the moſt proud heart, quicken the dead, puriſie the moſt vile affections, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Gates of Hell, overthrow ſin, diſpoſſeſs Satan; ſhould beget ſuch a River of Grief, kindle ſuch a flame of love, ſuch a zeal for God, tenderneſs in Conſcience, ſuch a ſtrength to do, and ſuffer, to believe, life in death, joy in ſorrows, hopes in deſpair; raiſe ſo high as to love them that hate us, bleſs them that curſe us, pray for them that deſpightfully uſe us, and do good for evil. 3. True Converſion <hi>is an inward change:</hi> When <note place="margin">It is an inward change.</note> a dead man is made alive, this is done by the infuſion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of life; the cloathing of a dead man is one thing, and the quickning of a dead man is another thing; it is one
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115664:158"/> thing to plaiſter an old houſe, and it is another thing to build a new houſe; Converſion may be conſidered two wayes; either 1. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively:</hi> So it is a change even of the life, and outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; it is a cleanſing of the fleſh, as well as of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it is a ſanctifying of the body, as well as of the ſoul: <hi>It is a putting off the former Converſation,</hi> Eph. 4. 22. 2. <hi>Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively:</hi> So it is an inward change; the Prophet calls it a waſhing of the heart, <hi>Waſh thine heart, O Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 44. 4. The Apoſtle calls it a <hi>transformation by the renewing of the mind,</hi> Rom. 2. 29. and a <hi>Circumciſion of the heart,</hi> Rom. 2. 29. St. <hi>John</hi> calls it, <hi>a laying the Ax to the root of the Tree,</hi> Mat. 3. 10. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calls it, the <hi>giving of a new heart, and of a new ſpirit,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. Every converted man hath a changed heart; we ſay in nature, that <hi>Cor eſt primum vivens:</hi> It is true alſo in Grace, the firſt work of quickning and converting Grace begins in the heart of a ſinner. The heart firſt fell from God, and it is the firſt that turns unto God. The heart is the firſt Seat of Sin, and it is the firſt Throne of Grace: Sin is the wound and diſeaſe of the heart, and Grace muſt bring the Plaiſter thither; ſin is firſt in the heart, and moſt in the heart; dominion is there, the poyſon is there; bring in the heart, prevail with it, and you bring in all the man: An outward change without an inward change, is 1. But <hi>Hypocriſie:</hi> The Hypocritical <hi>Phariſees made clean the outſide of the Cup, bùt not the inſide;</hi> a golden profeſſion and a rotten heart, this is but Hypocriſie. 2. But <hi>Vanity;</hi> it is to lap the Boughs, and leave the Roots which can ſend out more; it is to empty the Ciſtern, and to leave the Fountain running, which fills it again. 3. <hi>But ſelf and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit:</hi> What a fooliſh fancy is it to think my ſelf a converted man, becauſe my Tongue is quiet, and yet my heart doth curſe <note place="margin">Whether every internalchange be an evidence of true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115664:159"/> ſinner; for a man may hate the good which he knows, and love the evil which he knows; neither of which can conſiſt with true Converſion. 2. A change <hi>from error to truth.</hi> Many <note place="margin">F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A change <hi>from ſecurity to trouble</hi> and perplexity: It is poſſible that a great <note place="margin">From ſecurity to trouble.</note> ſinner who was as ſenſeleſs as the Rock, may now be as trembling as the Leaf, and his conſcience troubled as the Sea, and yet his heart not converted; <hi>Cain</hi> was troubled, ſo was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo was <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo was <hi>Judas,</hi> yet none of them converted: There is a trouble which riſeth from a quick conſcience, and there is a trouble which riſeth from quickning grace; this latter is an evidence of true Converſion, the other is not. 4. <hi>A temporary change,</hi> or <note place="margin">A temporary change.</note> rather a tranſient diverſity in the affections. It is poſſible for ſome ſcornful perſon to hear the Goſpel preached by ſome <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (as <hi>Herod</hi> did) with joy, and to hear ſome <hi>Paul</hi> (as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> did) with trembling, who formerly ſcorned all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yea, this man may be in a great changeableneſs, yet never be truly changed; divine truths may fall upon him with that evidence and efficacy, as to ſhake his heart, ſtir his affections, excite his reſolutions, and yet after a little while, as the cold doth on Water that is heated, all theſe workings expire into nothing, his old incorporated, familiar luſts prevail over them, and work them wholly out; till the inward change be a change of the heart, it is not a truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting change.</p>
               <p>4. Laſtly, true Converſion is <hi>an univerſal change:</hi> When <note place="margin">It is a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal change.</note> a dead man is quickned, the ſoul is not only infuſed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diffuſed, it is <hi>tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> the whole made alive; ſo is it in true Converſion, that grace which converts a ſinner, doth change all the ſinner, every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoul for the quality of it, and every member of the body, for the ſpiritual uſe of it: Therefore, converting
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115664:159"/> grace is compared to the <hi>Light</hi> which runs through all the body of the aire, every part whereof is inlightned; and it is compared to <hi>Leaven</hi> which ſpreads and inſinuates it ſelf into every part of the Lump. You cannot dip into any leaf of this Book, into any parcel of a converted man, but you ſhall find a divine and ſpiritual change, a ſpirit of grace on it. He is ſanctifyed throughout, <hi>in ſoul, ſpirit and body:</hi> I confeſs, it were a work worthy of the deepeſt ſtudy of the exacteſt Miniſter to find out, and deliver two things unto us: 1. One is, the <hi>Minimum quod ſic,</hi> the leaſt breath or life of converting grace. 2. Another is, <hi>The ſpecifical operations of converting grace, in all the faculties of the ſoul,</hi> ſo that one may ſay ſafely, this faculty is changed, and that faculty is changed by grace and nothing elſe. This I make no queſtion of, that converting grace doth make the whole man alive. For 1. It is a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>renewing quality.</hi> 2. It is of a <hi>diffuſive virtue,</hi> being a good in <hi>Genere optimorum.</hi> 3. It muſt be <hi>Co-extenſive with ſin,</hi> which hath perverted the whole man: But yet to ſet out its changing work in every faculty of the ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another is, that I intend not to give you <hi>Characters of a progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive change,</hi> which may be found in Chriſtians whom God hath called, and converted, and changed for many years, in whom the work of Converſion is come to much maturity and ſtrength; but only of an initial change, as it ſtands in truth and ſincerity, although newly wrought, and perhaps it be very feeble and weak, yet it is to be found in every man whom Divine Grace doth convert. Now this <hi>Initial change</hi> may be evidenced <hi>by the ſeveral contrary habitudes and fixed carriages in the converted</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The initial change eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cties.</note>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt contrariety or alteration, reſpects <hi>the time paſt:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">As to the time paſt.</note> Before the ſinner was converted, there were four unhappy qualities poſſeſſing of him, as touching his ſinfulneſs. 1. <hi>A marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous blindneſs,</hi> and reflexive unſenſibleneſs of his ſinful condition, <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Eph. 2. <hi>Paſt feeling,</hi> Eph. 4. 19. 2. <hi>A wonderful erroneouſneſs</hi> and falſe judgment of his eſtate; thinking highly and proudly of himſelf, as once <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115664:164"/> the Jews and Phariſees did; <hi>We are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and never in bondage,</hi> Joh. 8. 33. 3. <hi>A miſerable ſecurity of ſpirit,</hi> extreamly careleſs and negligent about the internal and eternal concernments of his ſoul; <hi>alive once without the Law,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe,</hi> &amp;c. They ſay, <hi>peace and ſafety,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 3. 4. <hi>A remorſeleſs purſuing of his ſinful luſts,</hi> without any heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiting troubles for his ſinning and provoking of God. <hi>No man repented, ſaying, What have I done? every one turned to his courſe,</hi> Jer. 8. 6. 5. <hi>Alienation from the life of God,</hi> Eph. 4. 18. Thus it was with the man, before God converted him, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him; but now behold the alteration and contrariety. 1. <hi>There is a graciouſly quick and active quickning light</hi> fallen into him, which opens his eyes, and affects his conſcience to a clear and right ſight of his ſinful heart and life. Rom. 7. 9. <hi>But when the Commandment came, ſin revived,</hi> &amp;c. As if the light of the Sun brake into a darkroom, and repreſented all the naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it. Acts 26. 18. <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> His ſins are ſet before him, and conſcience acquaints him with his forepaſt evils, ſo that he is convinced, and can make no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but cries out with the Leper, <hi>I am unclean, unclean.</hi> 2. <hi>All his erroneous and proud conceits of himſelf are tumbled down;</hi> the Mountains are laid low, and the man judgeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if he were the greateſt and vileſt ſinner that ever lived; he abhors himſelf, Oh, how wicked! Oh, how vain! Oh, how vile! Oh, how mad! Oh, how fooliſh! Oh, how beaſtly! I have been a tranſgreſſor from the womb; I have lived without God, againſt God; none ſo ignorant, none ſo proud, none ſo filthy, none ſo froward and rebellious againſt the Will of God, againſt the goodneſs of God as I: <hi>In me there dwelleth no good thing;</hi> I am without ſtrength: No man living hath ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thoughts, ſuch humble thoughts of himſelf as he. Oh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to dye, unworthy to live, undone if mercy be not free mercy, and abundant mercy. 3. <hi>His Caſtle of ſecurity is demoliſhed,</hi> and the ſecure negligent man becomes now a moſt anxious and ſolicitous and careful man about the condition of his ſoul. 2 Cor. 7. 11. <hi>What carefulneſs it wrought in you;</hi> this now takes him up. <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> ſay they to <hi>John the Baptiſt:</hi> And <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> ſay they to <hi>Peter:</hi> And <hi>what ſhall I do to be
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115664:164"/> ſaved?</hi> Acts 16. 30. O my Soul (my poor loſt, wandring, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, undone Soul) what ſhall I do? what will become of me? and what will become of thee for all theſe ſins? And now the man inquires, and hears, and confers, and prayes, as for his life: Oh (ſaith he) I need mercy, and mercy I muſt have; I need Chriſt, and Chriſt I muſt have; I need grace, and grace I muſt have; and as that impotent perſon lay at the Pool for cure, ſo doth this converted ſinner; he lyes at the pool of the word, and at the gates of heaven day and night; and there he cries out, God be merciful to me a ſinner; and there he <hi>wreſtles with God,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> once; <hi>I will not let thee go unleſs thou bleſs me;</hi> until thou be reconciled, until I have Chriſt, until my heart be ſanctifyed. 4. <hi>His hardned remorſeleſneſs is now turned into a ſingular brokenneſs</hi> and grief of ſpirit; the Rock is ſmitten, and the waters guſh out; a Fountain is opened within him: He who made but a ſport of ſinning before; he who could graſp the nettles, and tread on hell, and vex mercy, and ſhoot through the heart of Chriſt, and not be moved or troubled at all: Oh now, how is the man altered? I ſee him <hi>trembling</hi> and quaking with <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſee him bitterly <hi>weeping</hi> with <hi>Peter,</hi> I ſee him <hi>waſhing his Couch, with</hi> David; I ſee him in heavineſs and bitterneſs for his ſinnings, as one for his firſt born. One while he meditates, and then weeps; thus, and thus, and thus have I diſhonoured my God. Another while he hears, and reads, and weeps, I am that man, O Lord; I am he of whom thou ſpeakeſt, I am that ſinner; Iam he who hath out-faced thy Law, out-ſtood thy offers of grace, and reſiſted (Oh how often) thy good Spirit. 5. <hi>He is now for the life of God to be wrought in him:</hi> This he now prizeth as the moſt excellent life; and for this, he praies, Lord, another heart, a new ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond contrariety reſpects <hi>the time preſent:</hi> And <note place="margin">As to the time preſent.</note> there are four things for the time preſent, in a truely changed and converted perſon which never were in him before. 1. A preſent hatred of ſin. 2. A preſent flying unto Chriſt. 3. A preſent love of God. 4. A preſent courſe of new obedience. 1. When the Lord hath converted and changed the heart of a ſinner, there is wrought in him <hi>a preſent hatred of ſin;</hi> the man loved his ſins before, and took pleaſure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, held it faſt, and defended it; ſin is now ſeen as the greateſt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115664:165"/> evil, and the more he ſees it, the more he hates it: As ſoon as ever the heart is changed, immediately it is a ſin-hating heart; I do not ſay there is no ſin, but I ſay the heart hates ſin: <hi>The evil that I hate,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 15. and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. where God promiſeth to give them <hi>a new heart,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil wayes, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for your abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here now is a great Scruple, how a perſon may know that he hates ſin? Many think they do ſo, and are deceived, <note place="margin">How a man may know that he hates ſin.</note> it proves only a paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In true hatred there are ſix things. 1. <hi>An extream deteſtation:</hi> Every diſlike is not hatred, but true hatred is an extream loathing. <hi>Thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloath; thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence,</hi> Iſai. 30. 22. 2. <hi>An earneſt ſeparation:</hi> He that hated his wife did ſue out a Bill of divorce from her in the Law. 3. <hi>An irreconcileable alienation:</hi> Two angry men may be made friends; but if two men hate each other, friendſhip is everlaſtingly broken betwixt them. 4. <hi>A conſtant and perpetual colluctation:</hi> If they cannot be ſevered one from the other, they ſtill oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict one with the other. 5. <hi>A deadly intention</hi> and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for nothing ſatisfies hatred, but death and ruine; <hi>Saul</hi> hated <hi>David,</hi> and ſought his life, <hi>Abſalom</hi> hated <hi>Amnon,</hi> and killed him. 6. <hi>An impartial averſation;</hi> hatred is of the whole kind, <hi>I hate every falſe way:</hi> Wilt thou now know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath changed thy heart, then ask thy heart; What is it that thou abhorreſt as the ſuperlative evil? what is that which thou wouldſt have ſeparated as far from thee, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is from hell? what is that thy heart will never renew league or friendſhip with any more? what is that againſt which thy ſoul doth riſe, and with which (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Amalek,)</hi> thou haſt war for ever? what is that which thou wilt be avenged of, and daily doſt endeavour the mortifying and crucifying of? what is that which thou ſets thy heart againſt, in the comprehenſive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thereof, whether great, or little, open, or ſecret? If it be ſin, if it be thy ſins, aſſuredly here is true hatred of ſin, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly here is a moſt diſtinguiſhing Character of a ſound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and change. It was not wont to be thus with thee, nor
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115664:165"/> is this findeable in any unconverted perſon whoſoever. Sin was once to thee as <hi>Dalilah</hi> to <hi>Samſon,</hi> and now is it to thee as <hi>Tamar</hi> to <hi>Amnon.</hi> It was a ſweet morſel once which thou heldſt faſt, but now it is the menſtruous cloath which thou doſt caſt away, and ſay, get thee hence; what have I to do any more with Idols? If it be thus with thee, bleſs thy God who hath ſhewed grace to thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>2. When the Lord hath changed and converted the heart of a ſinner, <hi>the ſinner preſently flies unto Jeſus Christ:</hi> The firſt ſtroke of Grace is on the heart, and the firſt breathing of Grace is for Chriſt; as the new born babe flies unto the breſts, or as any creature doth to its center, and place of reſt. For when the heart is changed by converting grace, 1. It breeds the moſt exquiſite diſcovery and ſenſe of ſin, and conſequently of the ſouls need of Chriſt. 2. It is moſt impatient of diſtance or difference with God, and prizeth his reconciled favour ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, cannot live without it. 3. It ſeeth nothing more valuable in it ſelf, or more ſutable to its condition then Chriſt, <hi>Christus amor meus pondus meum.</hi> And therefore, if you take notice of it, you may experimentally find upon the firſt impreſſions of Grace, that the ſoul is moſtly taken up with Chriſt, and with Faith: Oh, that I might be found in him! Oh, that I could believe on him! It ſees excellency in Chriſt, and Peace in Chriſt, and Redemption in Chriſt, and Righteouſneſs in Chriſt, and Grace in Chriſt, and Kindneſs in Chriſt, and Help, and Life, and Heaven, and all in Chriſt. In Converſion, Chriſt ſecretly draws the Soul to himſelf; and being converted, the ſoul ſtrives to draw Chriſt to it ſelf; It would have Chriſt, it muſt have Chriſt; it is never well, it is never ſatisfied until it hath Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. When the Lord hath converted and changed the heart of a ſinner, there is wrought in him <hi>a preſent love of God:</hi> It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to ſee how the Tide turns upon Converſion. There was once one found weeping very bitterly; and being demanded, why! O, ſaid he, all other things are loved, but <hi>Amorum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur,</hi> Love it ſelf is not loved. So before Converſion, a man could find love for his Parents, and love for his Relations, and love for his Recreations, and love for his Profits, and love for his Sins; but no love for God. But after Converſion, the man can
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115664:166"/> ſcarce find any love for any, unleſs it be for his God, and in his God. A graciouſly changed Heart is enabled to ſee, 1. The glories in God; thoſe moſt Pure and Amiable Excellencies in God. 2. The Tranſcendent Love of God to it, in the Eternity of it, in the Freeneſs of it, in the Sweetneſs and Goodneſs of it. 3. The Unſpeakable Communications and Bounties of God towards it in Jeſus Chriſt; for the preſent, and for the future: It is Grace which makes us to ſee what a gracious God he is: It is Grace which makes us to ſee what a Royal gift Jeſus Chriſt is; It is Grace which makes us apprehenſive of all the Love in God, and from God; and therefore no marvel that the changed heart fals preſently in love with God; <hi>(O Love the Lord all ye his Saints)</hi> into a <hi>Love of Friendſhip,</hi> and into a <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> as they ſpeake; that it admires God, and prizeth Communion with him; and takes its full and higheſt delight in him: <hi>Pluſquam mea, pluſquam meos, pluſquam me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. When the Lord converts and changeth a perſon, the man preſently <hi>Steps into the path of new Obedience;</hi> when Grace hath changed the Heart, the Heart inſtantly changeth its Maſter and its ſervice; O it will not live as it hath done, for a thouſand Worlds; It is a ſervant of ſin no more, but a ſervant of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: look on any converted man (ſince the Word began,) as ſoon as ever Grace dropt into his Heart, a newneſs of Obedience dropt into his Life, againſt all Eaſe, Pleaſures, Profits, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, Diſcouragements, Threats, Dangers; It was ſo with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> with all thoſe <hi>thouſands</hi> in the Acts, with all thoſe <hi>Epheſians;</hi> And indeed it cannot be otherwiſe, foraſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch as all their external courſe is but the pulſe of the Heart. The <hi>Pondus</hi> of the will is changed, it is at the command of the Heart; which being brought into God, the ſervices of the heart are alſo brought in with it. O, that you would peruſe your ſelves in this ſecond Tryal, what preſent contratiety you find in your Hearts; It is a very neer Tryal, and a moſt Infallible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the truth or falſhood, or your Change.</p>
               <p>3. The laſt Contrariety or Change (which I ſhall but touch) <note place="margin">As to the time future.</note> reſpects <hi>the time Future:</hi> there are five admirable Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the time future, which may be found in every truly Changed and Converted perſon. 1. He is very tender
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115664:166"/> and fearful, leaſt he ſhould ſin againſt his God: <hi>Keep thy ſervant from preſum ptuous ſins; cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults:</hi> Pſal. 19. 12, 13. <hi>Should we again break thy Commandments!</hi> ſaid Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a, c. 9. 14. <hi>How can I do this Great wickedneſs, and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God!</hi> ſaid Joſeph, Gen. 39. 9. There is in a Changed and Converted man, 1. A tender Jealouſy over a Deceitful heart. 2. a tender Watchfulneſs, againſt Alluring temptations. 3. a tender Conſcience, which feels the firſt Riſings of ſin. 4. a tender Diſſidence of his Own ſtrength. 5. a tender Fear, and aweful Regard of Gods Preſence and Goodneſs. He is afraid to ſin, although the ſin be Secret; and although it be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious; and although it be Pleaſant. I will but name the reſt. 2. He is very Zealous and Active for God; <hi>Paul</hi> even beſides himſelf. 3. He is very Faithful and Conſtant unto God. 4. He is very Serious and Induſtrious, to get aſſurance of Gods love, and of his inheritance in the higheſt heavens. Give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. 5. He ſtrives for the Converſion and change of others.</p>
               <p>The next Uſe muſt be of <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Support,</hi> to <hi>all ſuch who find this change wrought in their hearts</hi> by converting Grace. <note place="margin">Uſe. 2.</note> There are four Adjuncts which make this Converting change <note place="margin">Comfort to thoſe who are changed.</note> unſpeakably Comfortable and Joyous. 1. <hi>Next to Chriſt it is the choiceſt and chiefeſt gift that the heart of man is capable of in this life.</hi> The gifts of God are of ſeveral Orders and ſeveral <note place="margin">Next to Chriſt it is the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt gift the heart is capable of.</note> Natures, uſes and ends; ſome are in order to a natural preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as food, and raiment, and Health. Some are in order to an extrinſecal condition or State of Life, as Honours and civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; Some are in order to private ſociety and relation, as Wife, and Husband, and Children; Some are in order to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar converſe, as Father and Friends, politick wiſdome, and parts, &amp;c. Theſe are all of them good in their kind, but as it is ſaid of diverſe Captaines belonging to <hi>David,</hi> although they did great matters, yet they attained not to the acts of the three firſt Worthies: So none of theſe riſe or mount ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that intrinſecal Dignity, or to that ſupernatural and ultimate End, which the change by Grace doth; The leaſt drop of Grace is more then all the Ocean of the World. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it is <hi>a change from Glory to Glory;</hi> the work is a work of Glory and the man
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115664:167"/> becomes glorious who is a converted man. <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is now made partaker of the Divine Nature:</hi> The excellencies of God are ſtamped on thy ſoul; the Sun is now riſen within thee as the Glory of God filled the Temple: ſo when a man is converted, the beams of grace do fill his ſoul; thou art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, the filthy rags are taken away.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It is an evidence of great love and rich mercy,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. <hi>But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of great love.</note> 
                  <hi>loved us when we were dead, hath quickned us,</hi> &amp;c. It is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the greateſt love, as it is of the greateſt hatred in God, to be left to our ſinful luſts and wayes.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Converting grace it is the firſt, viſible and ſure characteriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is the firſt viſible diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt hell and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> 
                  <hi>diſtinction twixt Hell and Heaven,</hi> twixt Death and Life, twixt a Goat and a Sheep, twixt a wicked condition, and a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition. There is a twofold diſtinction of perſons touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their everlaſting eſtates: One is <hi>in decreto,</hi> which lies in the breſt and counſel of God; the other is <hi>in decreto,</hi> which is to be found in the heart of man. Now <hi>quoad nos &amp; quantum ad obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi> Converting grace makes the difference, it ſhews who is loved, and who is hated; it ſhews who is for Heaven, and who is for Hell. It is not honour, nor wealth, nor ſtrength, nor parts, nor civility, nor meanneſs, nor poverty, nor education, nor knowledg, nor trouble of conſcience, nor reſtraint, nor profeſſion, nor external action, which is the partition wall which divides and decides the ſtate for the preſent and future. If Miniſters or Angels ſhould aſſure thee of an intereſt in Chriſt, and of remiſſion of thy ſins, and of future happineſs while yet thy heart is unconverted, they do certainly delude and deceive thee; for if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: But if God hath converted and changed thy heart, thou art aſſuredly paſt from death to life, thou art among the firſt born of God: No ſorts of wicked men are in this changed and converted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, no prophane perſon, no hypocritical perſon; as ſoon as any is converted, it may be ſaid of him, as Chriſt of <hi>Zacheus, This day is ſalvation come to him, for as much as he alſo is a child of</hi> Abraham.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>It never goes alone,</hi> it is alwayes accompanied with juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <note place="margin">It never goes alone.</note> pardon, intereſt in Chriſt, reconciliation with God. <hi>Jeſus was ſent to bleſs them in turning them away from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:115664:167"/> Acts 3. 26. <hi>Be converted that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together,</hi> Iſai. 55. 7. 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctifyed, but ye are juſtifyed,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">It is the moſt comfortable condition.</note>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>It is the moſt comfortable and joyful condition;</hi> for now there is a change of all, without and within you. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſouls are <hi>glad,</hi> Acts 2. 47. the converted <hi>Jailor rejoyced, Acts</hi> 16. 34. the <hi>Eunuch rejoyced, Acts</hi> 8. 6, 8. The firſt work of the Spirit is <hi>grace,</hi> the next is <hi>joy;</hi> Heaven now ſtands open for you to ſee all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Threatnings are turned into promiſes, curſes into bleſſings, enemies unto friends, aliens into ſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing into an excuſing conſcience, voice of terror into a voice of peace, hell into heaven. <note place="margin">It is the only unprejudicial change on earth.</note>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>It is the only unprejudicial change on earth:</hi> In all other changes there is either diminution or danger. If a rich man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes poor, there is a diminution of his Condition; if a poor man becomes rich, there is a danger to his ſpirit, leſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes covetous or proud. If a man be lifted up to greatneſs and authority, there is a danger, leſt he forgets God, and be injurious; if an healthy man becomes ſick and weak, here is an impairing, a loſs and danger of life: Only, when a wicked man is converted, and becomes holy, there is neither diminution nor danger; converting grace is no thief in the Candle: It is no preternatural heat which ſucks away that which is vital; thou loſeſt nothing at all by it, no ſpot to thy credit, no burden to thy conſcience, no eclipſe to thy honour, no gall in thy Cup, nor waſt to thy Lands: It doth not darken thy name, nor weaken thy ſtrength, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh thy coffers, nor imbitter thy comforts: No loſs but the loſing of ſin, which we cannot keep but to our loſs; all that it doth is this, that it decreaſeth and deſtroyeth thy ſinful luſts; it roots out thoſe weeds, it pulls out hell, it heals thy wounds, and is the deadly enemy to thy deadlieſt enemies.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>The converting change is an unchangeable change:</hi> The next change is into Heaven. A wicked man may be changed <note place="margin">It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable change.</note> into a Godly man, and a Godly man may be changed into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the Godly man ſhall never be changed again into a wicked man; the ſtate of grace is an unchangeable ſtate, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition them <hi>Adams</hi> in Paradiſe; his was perfect but mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, this is imperfect, but not changeable: Once a Son, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115664:168"/> ever a Son; <hi>the Son abides in the houſe for ever</hi> (ſayes Chriſt;) once converted, and for ever bleſſed. Gods converting Grace is an abiding ſeed, and it is immortal ſeed, and it is a gift which God never repents of, although much of the ſtrength of it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by our falls, as fire is raked up under the aſhes; although the ſenſe of it doth ſometime fail us, and the comfort, and the livelineſs of operation appears not, yet as there is life in the root, though there be not leaves on the Tree, and as there is a ſoul in the man, though ſickneſs be in his body, ſo the truth and ſtate of grace continues under all a Chriſtians eclipſes, weakneſſes, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for converting grace comes from an unchangeable will in God, the will of his love, whom he loves once, he loves to the end. 2. <hi>It depends upon an everlaſting Communion with Chriſt,</hi> who marries the ſoul to himſelf for ever. 3. And it is given as a <hi>pledg and pawn of eternal glory.</hi> 4. And it is <hi>aſſiſted with an everlaſting arm,</hi> and power of God.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>No other change ſhall hurt you, but further you:</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">No other change ſhall hurt us, but further us.</note> Death, it is gain unto you, it is the laſt ſtile, and then you are at home for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now ſome diſtreſſed perſon may reply, Theſe are comforts indeed, but not to me; for I fear that my heart is not changed, nor yet truly changed; I am not indeed altogether what once I was, but this I fear is but a ſtop of conſcience, or but the fruit of hypocriſie. Oh, I feel ſuch changes on my ſpirit! <note place="margin">I fear I am not truly changed.</note> it is not alwayes alike, and ſo much ſinfulneſs, ſo much unbelief, ſo much hardneſs, ſo much difficulty to good, ſo much weakneſs under temptations; ſurely my change is not true, a great, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a total change, and therefore none of theſe comforts apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Shall I ſpeak a few words to ſuch a perſon, (ſurely ſome ſuch there may be.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The change by Converſion is but imperfect in this life;</hi> it is a total change, although it changeth us not totally: A converted <note place="margin">This change is but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life.</note> man is ſanctifyed throughout, but not perfectly throughout; when the day breaks, there is a change that one may truly ſay, the night is paſt, and yet many degrees of darkneſs ſtick in the air; as ſoon as ever God infuſeth grace into the ſoul, there is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a change as to the denomination of the eſtate, though not as to the conſummation of the eſtate; <hi>Paul</hi>'s eſtate was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115664:168"/> and changed eſtate, and yet there was a <hi>Law in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> as well as a <hi>Law in his Mind,</hi> Rom. 7. Converſion is a change from the dominion of what was contrary, not from the abſolute being of a contrary. Though a Tyrant dwell and ſtirs in a Kingdome, yet if a lawful Monarch rules, the Kingdome is changed: Many ſins are in a converted man ſtill; but if grace doth rule the heart now, which formerly was ruled by ſin, that man is a changed man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Converting grace, although it be wrought at once, yet it is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Converting grace, though wrought at once, yet is brought on by degrees.</note> 
                  <hi>brought on by degrees:</hi> The truth of it begins in an inſtant, but the ſtrength of it comes in time. It is a very curious queſtion why God gives Grace by degrees, or ſucceſſively in this life, and not all at once, but ſtill leaves ſome ſinful corruption behind. Divines conjecture three reaſons of it? 1. <hi>Our preſent inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a preſent fulneſs:</hi> The Bottle cannot be filled but by degrees, though the Ocean be full; there is as much grace given at firſt as to make a new creature, but not a ſtrong creature. 2. <hi>Our eſtate on earth, muſt be a combating eſtate,</hi> to difference the eſtate of grace and glory; that in heaven only is the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and triumphing. 3. And it is an <hi>eſtate of faith,</hi> which is a continual dependance, and a continual drawing of help, and a continual recourſe to the fountain: In Creation, Perfection of being was at once, and in Glorification at once; but not ſo in Sanctification, this riſes like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Water, or like the light of the Sun. This may yet ſatisfie thee, though grace be imperfect and not full at once. 1. Juſtification is perfect. 2. Though you find but little, yet you cannot be fatisfyed without more. 3. You have perfecting means of holineſs, though you have not perfect holineſs; a word to build you up. 4. That God who hath begun, has promiſed to finiſh, and your little is a pledg of more. 5. Truth of grace may lye in a little compaſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There may be many changes upon the ſpirit of a man, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">There may be many changes not inconſiſtent with the ſaving change.</note> 
                  <hi>yet are not inconſiſtent with the ſaving change of his Spirit:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he may be lively and quick, ſometimes he may be flat and dull, ſometimes he may be confident and cheerful, and at ſome other times he may be afraid and mournful; ſometimes he may be full, and enlarged; and at ſome other time he may be aukard, and ſtreightned; ſometimes he may have more ſenſe of Gods Love, and ſometimes more ſenſe of his own ſins: None of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115664:169"/> theſe things are eſſential to the converted eſtate; a mans heart may be truly changed by converting grace, notwithſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſſes and afflictions on his outward eſtate, many eclipſes in his comforts, many varieties in his ſpiritual actings, many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties twixt his ſence and his faith, many temptations upon his ſpirit, to many doubts and fears in his heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Sinful corruptions never work with a more ſenſible ſtrength,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sinful corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions work with more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtrength when the heart is truely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> 
                  <hi>then when the heart is truly converted and changed:</hi> Before Converſion, our ſins do work more mightily, but we do not then perceive the workings, becauſe your delight was then in ſinning, and nothing is burthenſome to delight; and nothing was in us contrary to our ſinnings; the ſtrong man kept all the houſe, and every faculty was a friend and ſervant to ſin; the river ran all one way: But when the heart is converted, there is now laid into it 1. The quickeſt principle of feeling. 2. The contrarieſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of reſiſting. 3. The propereſt principle of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſin; and therefore no marvel that we feel our ſinful natures more than formerly; for all qualities are moſt active, and moſt felt in caſes of reſiſtance and deſtruction; nevertheleſs none of theſe muſt conclude againſt our Converſion, but rather for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 1. The greateſt work of grace is inward. 2. The ſenſe of ſinful workings joyned with an hatred of them, and humbling of the heart under them, and with addreſſes to God for ſubduing power, is certainly a ſign of converting grace: Therefore hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto me thou diſtreſſed ſoul: 1. Though the <hi>Glory of Grace</hi> conſiſts in <hi>Victory,</hi> yet the <hi>Truth of Grace</hi> appears in <hi>Combats;</hi> the fighting Souldier is as right to the cauſe, as the conquering Souldier: there is fire in the <hi>ſmoking flax,</hi> as well as in the flaming furnace. 2. That <hi>great corruptions</hi> ſtill remaining in temptation, are the <hi>burdens of a weak Chriſtian,</hi> but are not the <hi>Characters of a falſe Chriſtian.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt can by a <hi>little grace weaken ſtrongeſt corruptions:</hi> The leaſt true grace will help thy ſoul to Chriſt, through whoſe ſtrength thou who art now in conflict ſhalt ere long be made more than a Conqueror. 4. <hi>True grace begins in weakneſs,</hi> goes on with <hi>combat,</hi> but ends in <hi>victory:</hi> There is but little light at the firſt, and more darkneſs for quantity; but the light of the Sun is riſing, and diſſipating, and at length remains alone. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering grace hath comfort, conflicting grace hath ſtrength, and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115664:169"/> even mourning grace hath truth; <hi>Peter</hi>'s tears ſhewed truth of Grace, as well as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Triumph.</p>
               <p>But how may I deſcern my <hi>change to ariſe from the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How it may be diſcerned, that this change is from convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>grace,</hi> and not from the power only of a troubling conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>Sol.</hi> I conceive thus, in four particulars. 1. <hi>When the change is made only from the ſting of conſcience, that change goes off, and vaniſheth,</hi> when the trouble of conſcience goes off, and continues only while that doth continue: whiles the trouble of conſcience is on the man, the man will hear, and the man will pray, and the man will conſult, and profeſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, yea, and now too, to become a new man; yea, and he will cry out againſt his ſins, and will not come near his ſins. But when that trouble is off, all is off again; the Water which was heated, grows cold again; <hi>Saul</hi> is purſuing <hi>David</hi> again, and <hi>Foelix</hi> is covetous again. But if the change be from grace, though trouble be off, yet the heart is againſt ſin, and is for good; for grace ſets us againſt ſin, as it makes us unholy, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and not only, or principally, as it makes us uncomfortable and miſerable. 2. When the change ariſeth only from a troubling conſcience, not from a contrariety to God, but to us: <hi>It doth not ariſe from a hatred of ſin, and a love of good; but only from a hatred of torment, a ſelf-love,</hi> and a love of eaſe; the man loves that ſin, that he dares not now commit, and hates the good which now he doth; he doth the good, only as a means to take off his trouble; he doth it not as a work in which he delights, nor doth he flie ſin as an evil which he hates; he flies ſin as it is <hi>malum ſenſibile,</hi> not as it is <hi>malum ſpirituale:</hi> But in a gracious change, trouble doth not cauſe hatred, but hatred cauſeth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſin. 3. When the change is only from a troubling conſcience, <hi>then when the trouble is gone, the mans heart is more hardned,</hi> and he growes more wicked then ever before, and in after ſinnings, leſs ſenſible, and leſs troubled; as Iron growes more hardned after it hath been in the fire, or water that is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped more violent. <hi>If they be again intangled, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. But where the heart is changed by grace, the more grace, ſtill the more ſenſe of ſin, and ſtill the more fear to ſin, and ſtill the more love of God. 4. When the change comes only from the trouble of conſcience, <hi>the change extends no further then to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115664:170"/> that,</hi> or thoſe particular ſins for which the conſcience doth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the man; if the other ſins trouble not, they are not left: But when the change is wrought by grace, this change extends to all ſins. <hi>I hate every evil way</hi> (ſaith <hi>David;) they do no iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>Let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may a man know that his <hi>change is not the fruit of Hypocriſie,</hi> but of Converting grace? <hi>Sol.</hi> This may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <note place="margin">How it appears, this change is not the fruit of Hypocriſie.</note> thus. 1 The change by Hypocriſie 1. <hi>Is not Cordial;</hi> no Hypocrites heart is changed: <hi>In heart ye work wickedneſs.</hi> The Hypocrite dares to give way to heart ſins: Judah <hi>turned</hi>

And why will we not take a little pains to have our hearts and ſouls changed by grace: Conſider ſeriouſly, 1. <hi>That a man is not excluded</hi>

Is this the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115664:170"/> fruit of thy dreadful Covenant which thou haſt made with him? 4. <hi>What wilt thou get by keeping thy ſins,</hi> or any one of them? <note place="margin">What wilt thou get by keeping thy ſins.

Magdalen</hi> ſo! <hi>Paul</hi> ſo! the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo! Why, venture toward his mercy ſeat; who can tell but he may do ſo to thee? 4. <hi>He hath changed ſinners, who have not ſought him;</hi> and will he refuſe it for them, who do ſeek it of him? if he many times be found of them that ſeek him not, will he deny to them, who ſeek? 5. <hi>You have his promiſe to do this very converting work for you; He will give his holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11. 13. <hi>I will give a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. Behold he calls thee, he tells thee that he is willing to convert thee, why, then art thou not willing to receive it, to have it done? do not ſay, thou art a ſinner; God never did convert any but a ſinner, nor does he promiſe to convert any, who is not a ſinner. 6. <hi>Did ever any beg this, and failed of it? Lord</hi> (ſaid one to Chriſt) <hi>If thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> (what, ſaith Chriſt to him? doth he not anſwer him at all? Doth he ſay, I cannot? Or doth he ſay, I will not?

To come to the Word, and come for this end,</hi> that God may convert and change; many came <note place="margin">Come to the word for this end.</note> to the <hi>Pool of Betheſda,</hi> to look on it; and an <hi>impotent man</hi> came thither to be cured in it, and there he was cured; many come to hear the Word, to mock at it; and many come to get ſome notions from it, and many come to catch the Miniſter at it, but he who comes for this very end to be converted and changed by it, I believe he ſhall firſt or laſt attain his end; the word ſhall convert and change him.

The caſe is wonderfully altered with him, (all is altered, when the ſinner is altered) when he was wandring from his Father, he ran up and down the Country, and waſted all his eſtate among Harlots; he ſhifted himſelf to his very skin, and out he is turned amongſt the Swine, and no man regarded him; the poor wretch wanted Father, and Houſe, and Cloaths, and all Comforts, and was upon his laſt Leggs, at the very point of ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and famiſhing. But now being found and returned home, all mercies come in unto him; there's a Father to embrace him, and an Houſe to entertain him, and Raiment to cloath him, and Friends to welcome him, and a feaſt to rejoyce him. <hi>[And they began to be merry:]</hi> As formerly you have had the nature of Converſion, ſo in theſe, you have the <hi>fruit of Converſion.</hi> When Jeſus Chriſt was born, there was great joy; and when a ſinner is born again, hereupon alſo ariſeth great joy.

                  <hi>That Converſion brings the Soul into a joyful, a very joyful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> [They began to be merry] Mirth is the accent of joy, <note place="margin">

Converſion may
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115664:171"/> be conſidered three wayes. 1. <hi>Antecedenter:</hi> For the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities and works, which immediately go before, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily uſher in Converſion; ſo it is ſad, and bitter, and ſharp; for there the law imprints a ſenſe of ſin, and of wrath, and a ſpirit of bondage to fear; the Needle pricks, and the Sword cuts and wounds, and the Hammer bruiſeth, and the Plough rents and tears. 2. <hi>Formaliter:</hi> as it is a perfective change, and alteration, even from hell to heaven, from baſeſt luſts, to ſweeteſt holineſs; and thus it is (at the leaſt) a fundamental, radical, and virtual joy. 3. <hi>Conſequenter:</hi> For the Crop and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent harveſt, which reſults out of Converſion; thus it is the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick after the tuning of the ſtrings; the fruit of righteouſneſs is peace, ſo the fruit of converſion is joy and delight.

Converſion drops out of the Eternal Love of God to a mans ſoul. <hi>Behold what manner of Love,</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 1. as <hi>many as were ordained to eternal life</hi> believed, Acts. 13. 2. <hi>The Meritorious cauſe: Who loved us and gave himſelf for us,</hi> Gal. 2. It is one part of Chriſts purchaſe, he merited Grace and Glory for his. 3. <hi>The Efficient cauſe;</hi> (immediately efficient) it is the firſt breath of Gods ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, the Spirit of true Comfort and Joy. 4. <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe;</hi> the word which is called ſweet, and ſweeter then the Hony, and the breaſts of Conſolation, is the inſtrument of Converſion, Jam. 1. 2. <hi>Its owne Nature.</hi> Converting Grace hath three things intrinſecal unto it. 1. <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> it is <note place="margin">By the Nature of it.</note> good, and it only makes us good: Now Goodneſs is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Delight; Nothing is truly pleaſant, but what is truly good. 2. <hi>Suteableneſs;</hi> There is nothing ſo ſuteable either to the nature of the ſoul, or end of the ſoul, as true Grace. 3. <hi>Perfection;</hi> it is the Glory of the Soul.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The acts flowing from it;</hi> If the acts flowing from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion be ſuch as God himſelf takes delight in, <hi>(He takes delight</hi>

Againe, there cannot be a greater delight and joy then when an Active and Actual intercourſe is maintained twixt an immortal Soul and perfect Bleſſedneſs; when my Soul hath a free converſs with Bleſſedneſs it ſelf, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs it ſelf hath a Gracious converſe with my ſoul, this is as if two deeply in Love converſed with each other: this is as if <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> met together; this is as if <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> met together, and infinitely more: But upon Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the ſoul and God have mutual communications. (And is not
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115664:173"/> God the bleſſedneſs of mans ſoul, and is not bleſſedneſs a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant ſight) God ſpeaks to that ſoul, and that ſoul ſpeaks with God; the ſoul opens its ſelf to God, and God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens himſelf to that ſoul. <hi>Ergò.</hi>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What kind of Joy and Pleaſure doth Converſion bring unto the Soul. <hi>Sol.</hi> There are five properties in the joy which Converſion lets into the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a lawful Joy</hi> and Pleaſure. There are many things which are pleaſent, but they are not Lawful: <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> but God allowes them not; the Tree in the garden was Pleaſant, but it was not Lawful for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to taſte of. Sinful wayes afford ſome kind of joy, but that joy is forbidden fruit; God hath curſed ſin and all that comes out of ſin. <hi>Agrippina</hi> poyſoned her husband with the meat he moſt delighted in. Wicked men delight and rejoyce in ſinful things, but this is only ſweet Poyſon, God allowes it not; nor is it ſafe: But converſion yeilds a Joy, which the ſoul may ſafely feed on; It is lawful to rejoyce in the Lord, and to rejoyce in Chriſt, and to reioyce in the pardon of our ſins, and to rejoyce that our names are written in the book of Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>a Spiritual Joy;</hi> A Joy that reacheth to the ſpirit of Man, and that becomes the ſpirit of man, and that raiſeth the <note place="margin">A Spiritual joy.</note> ſpirit of man. 1. Many men have joy in their faces, and yet not joy in their hearts; A man in a feaver hath a lively colour, when yet he hath a dying heart; and many have joy in their tongues and mouthes, and yet no joy in their conſciences. As he ſaid to one that commended his fine ſhoe, But you doe not know where it pincheth me; a wicked man hath an hell in his conſcience, who yet hath a ſmile in his countenance; But a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted mans joy, is an heart joy; <hi>My ſervants ſhall ſing for joy of heart,</hi> Iſa. 65. 14. <hi>My Spirit rejoiceth in God my Savior,</hi> ſaid Mary, Luk. 2. 2. And it is a ſpirit becoming joy. <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſeemly for a fool,</hi> ſaid <hi>Solomon;</hi> There are joyes which are not ſeemly nor becoming an Immortal ſoul: <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid of ſome pleaſures, that they were fit for ſalves, not for Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115664:173"/> a wicked man takes joy either in Vile things, which fight againſt the Soul; or in vain things, which are below a Soul; his joyes are fetcht out of hell, or out of the Creature; either ſuch joyes as delight the Devil, or delight the beaſts, or delight the baſeſt and vaineſt of men; in Whoring, and Drinking, and Curſing, and Dicing, and Dancing, and Gaming, and Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and Masking &amp;c. But Converſion feeds the Soul with the joyes of the Holy Ghoſt, with Divine joy, joy drawn out of the wells of Salvation, Iſa. 12. 2. And it is a Spirit-raiſing joy: when the ſoul is caſt down, and all the comforts on Earth cannot lift it up and chear it, yet Converſion can let in a fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cordial; It can open a window to ſee the light of Gods countenance and favour, which can turn night into day, and troubles into peace, and heavineſs into an exceeding joy; even Davids, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul?</hi> into <hi>Praiſe the Lord O my Soul 3. It is a wonderfull Joy;</hi> There are two caſes wherein men do wonder, how a man can poſſibly be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <note place="margin">A wonderful Joy.</note> 1. One is, when all the comforts of the Creature fail him; not a Candle but is without light, not a Well but is ſtopt; not a Spring but is dry; No friend to look on and pity, no main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, no ſubſiſtance: Yet in ſuch a caſe (which is wont to be a time Sighs and Tears) can a converted man rejoyce. Hab. 3. 17. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vine, The labor of the Olive ſhall faile, and the field ſhall yeild no meat, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another is, when all outward miſeries are upon him: as when all his outward eſtate is taken away, yet then converted perſons have taken <hi>joyfully the ſpoyling of their Goods,</hi> Heb. 10. 34. When Afflictions, Deriſions, Reproaches, Bonds, Impriſonments, Scourgings, cruel Torments, are laid on him; Yet ſaith Paul, <hi>Wee rejoyce in Tribulations alſo, Rom.</hi> 5. 3.

Notwithſtanding all his joyes, he lies under the power of a Guilty, and Accuſing, and Condemning Conſcience; but now the Converted mans joy is a Perfect joy, a Wel-grounded joy; God loves him, Chriſt hath ſatisfyed for him, his heart is ſanctifyed, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pacified. 5. It is <hi>a well ending joy;</hi> A joy which ends <note place="margin">A well ending Joy.</note> in joy: an unconverted man hath his joyes and pleaſures, but they end in Griefe and horror. O my poor Soul, ſaid <hi>Adrian,</hi> when he was dying, whither art thou now going? all thy Mirth, and Joy, are at an end: <hi>nec ut ſoles dabis jocos,</hi> thou art going away, and all thy joyes are going away: Luk. 16. 15. But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dives, Remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and Lazarus evill things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. Dives</hi> fared ſumptuouſly every day, he had pleaſure on earth, but after them his ſoul went into hell torments: he never had pleaſure more. Babylon, it is ſaid of her Rev. 18. 7. <hi>how much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment</hi> and <hi>ſorrow give her:</hi> Job ſpeaking of the Wicked, chap. 21. 7. ſaith, <hi>That they take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ:</hi> v. 12. <hi>they ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go down to the Grave: Solomon</hi> ſpeaks ironically to the Voluptuous Youthes, Eccleſ. 11. 9. <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy Youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the dayes of thy Youth, and walk in the wayes of thine heart,</hi> and <hi>in the ſight of thine eyes;</hi> But <hi>know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgment:</hi> So then the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115664:174"/> converted man's joy, is a ſhort joy, and a joy that ends in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſorrow: But a converted man's joy, is a laſting joy, and it ends in perfect joy; when he dies, yet his grace dies not, yet his joy dies not: <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, enter into thy Maſter's joy;</hi> the end of life, is the beginning of all joy.</p>

               <p n="4">4. True Converſion, <hi>It is a Claſpe, the Golden Claſpe of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is the claſp of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace</note> 
                  <hi>that everlaſting Covenant of Gods Grace.</hi> Note here two things. 1. All the deſireable delicacies of the ſoul are treaſured up in the Covenant of Gods Grace; in it are contained all the gracious attributes in God, all the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections of God, all the gracious relations of God, all the gracious promiſes and engagements of God. There you find the reconciled God, the merciful God, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning God, the ſin-ſubduing God, the ſtrengthning and helping God, the guiding and upholding God, the bleſſing and comforting God; you cannot think of a mercy for the ſoul, of a mercy for the body, of a mercy for this life, of an happineſs after this life, but there it is, but there it is for you, but there it is aſſuredly for you. 2. Every converted perſon is in this Covenant; Why! the new heart, and the new ſpirit, (is not this Converſion?) are a very part of it; <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. I will give them a new heart, and a new ſpirit:</hi> If this be ſo, then certainly Converſion brings a perſon
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115664:175"/> into a very joyful condition. Mark a little: If the mercies which many receive only from Providence do delight and pleaſe them, ſhall not the mercies which men receive from Gods Covenant pleaſe and rejoyce them? Bread is ſweet to an hungry man, out of whatſoever hand it comes; and is it not more ſweet when it comes out of the hand of love and kindneſs? O Sirs! even the ordinary mercies to a converted man, have a ſweet diſtinction in them; they are ſo perfumed, they are ſo diſtilled, they are ſo carved, they are all of them the kiſſes of a father, the gifts of a gracious God. Every bit of Bread thou eateſt, and every draught of Beer thou drinkeſt, and every piece of Cloath thou weareſt, it is the ſpecial proviſion of thy moſt gracious God, and thy lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father: If ſome one royal mercy in the Covenant be able ſometimes to ſweeten an Ocean, to turn hell into heaven, to wipe off all tears, and put the ſoul almoſt into an extaſie of joy; what rivers of joy then can the whole Covenant afford? If the lifting up of the light of Gods countenance upon the ſoul, (which is but one beam of the Covenant) if his ſaving to a man, Soul, I am thy Salvation; if one word, <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> imprints a ſuperlative comfort, a joy unſpeakable and full of glory; if one drop be ſo ſweet, how ſweet is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? if one Grape, what is the cluſter of Grapes? Now not only this or that mercy in the Covenant belongs to a converted man, but every mercy, the God of all mercies, and all the mercies of God; the God of all comforts, and all the comforts of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. True Converſion, <hi>It is the infallible fore-runner, the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forerunner of glory.</note> 
                  <hi>earneſt, the pawn of Glory:</hi> the pledg which God leaves in hand, the firſt fruits of thy eternal Glory in the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and is not this a cauſe of great joy? if I look back, and ſee a love from all eternity; if forward, and ſee a glory to all eternity. Truly, if I ſhould never taſte Honey on earth; if all the Wells of a preſent comfort were ſtopped up, if my Father ſhould never ſmile on me in the way, if all my Life were a ſayling on briniſh tears, and my Ship were ſtill to be toſſed with troubleſome waves; yet, if I were ſure at length to put in at this Port, to come ſafe to Heaven at length, to appear
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115664:176"/> before the God of Gods at the laſt, to ſee him in Glory, and enjoy his face, and the pleaſures at his right hand for evermore, even this confidence and aſſurance were enough to make me to rejoyce in the hope of the Glory of God. Oh Chriſtian, beſides all that joy which ariſeth from converting grace (which is it ſelf a ſweet Roſe) and beſides all thoſe Honey dewes which fall upon the ſoul in the exerciſe of grace, in the way to Heaven, <hi>(Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy wayes,</hi> Iſai. 64. 5.) There is alſo reſerved in the higheſt heavens, that moſt perfect happineſs, that moſt perfect tranquillity, that moſt perfect joy; Oh, I cannot expreſs it, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. 1 Pet. 1. 3. <hi>He hath begotten us again unto a lively hope.</hi> v. 4. <hi>To an inheritance incorruptible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you.</hi> 
                  <q>Ponder the words; an inheritance, the beſt of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; incorruptible, the beſt of inheritances; undefiled, the beſt of incorruptibles; unfading, the beſt of undefileds; and reſerved in heaven, the beſt of unfadings: Nothing is ſo ſurely kept as that which is kept in heaven for us, and born unto all this, and a lively hope of all this: Oh, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort!</q> Oh, what joy comes out of all this! If I had all the world, and lookt up towards heaven, but my heart ſhould tell me, that goodly <hi>Canaan</hi> will never fall to thy portion; it would be now with me, as once with <hi>Ahab,</hi> who, though he enjoyed a Kingdome, <hi>yet was very ſad, becauſe the heavens were as Braſs to him.</hi> But in the midſt of all diſtreſſes to look up to Heaven, to think of God, and the future Beatifical Viſion, and upon infallible grounds, to ſay, that God is my Father, that Heaven is my inheritance, that place of Glory is my home, there ſhall I be ſhortly, there ſhall I be to eternity, I have the earneſt of it, the pawn of it in my heart, the firſt fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, <hi>As to Chriſt:</hi> The converted condition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">As to Chriſt.</note> but be joyful, becauſe the converted perſon hath. 1. <hi>A neer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt;</hi> Bone of his Bone. 2. <hi>A ſingular propriety in Chriſt; my beloved is mine,</hi> &amp;c. 3. <hi>An admirable revenue by Chriſt;</hi> wonderful riches, of and by Chriſt <hi>all are yours, for ye are Chriſts. 4. He is bought by Chriſt,</hi> and reconciled by Chriſt, and loved by Chriſt, and diſcharged by Chriſt, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115664:176"/> owned by Chriſt, and defended by Chriſt, and kept by Chriſt, and ſhall one day be ſaved by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>As to Conſcience:</hi> As a mans conſcience is, ſo is his comfort <note place="margin">As to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> or diſcomfort, ſo is his joy or ſorrow: One drop of an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> doth imbitter the whole Sea of worldly joy: an evil conſcience is an hell in the breſt, and in hell (ſaid <hi>Latimer)</hi> there is no mirth: and on the contrary, a good conſcience it is a kind of heaven; one good word from it will ſweeten all our miſeries, and cauſe us to rejoyce under all ſorrows. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>it is a continual feaſt,</hi> it is the year of <hi>Jubilee;</hi> conſcience ſpeaks the trueſt joy, and the ſtrongeſt joy, and the higheſt joy, and no man hath a good conſcience but a good man: Conſcience cannot ſpeak peace till a man be converted; and when he is converted, conſcience hath then a commiſſion and authority to look on the man, and ſpeak to the man as God doth. When thou heareſt of pardon of ſins, Oh, ſaith conſcience, hearken and be of good cheer, thats thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: when thou heareſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his ſufferings, and of his ſatisfactions, and merits, hearken, ſaith conſcience, and take hold, for all this alſo is thy portion; when thou heareſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace graciouſly explained, and all the glories in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Oh, ſaith conſcience, all this alſo is thy portion: when thou art about to pray, and fears are intruding themſelves; do not fear, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith conſcience, thou art ſpeaking to thy Father: when thou art about to dye, and tremblings are upon thee, do not doubt or tremble, ſaith conſcience, thou art going to thy God: when Satan ſuggeſts thou haſt nothing to do with the mercy-ſeat, what, ſuch a ſinner? thou haſt, ſaith conſcience; when unbelief ſuggeſts, Chriſt will have nothing to do with thee, he will, ſaith conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Now, againſt all that hath been ſaid; it is objected, That the aſſertion of joy for a converted perſon cannot be true: Becauſe 1. No perſons are ſo expoſed to afflictions, and perſecutions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famies as converted perſons. They are appointed to them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. And they that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; how can that condition be ſo very joyful, which may, and oftentimes doth deprive a man of all his comforts. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion brings the perſon into a narrow path, and under the ſtraiteſt rules, even ſuch as condemn, and cut off a world of pleaſures, and delights; can that condition be very joyful which denies us the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115664:177"/> fruition of many joyes and delights. 3. Converſion breeds the deepeſt ſenſe of ſin, and the greateſt mourning for ſins: Nothing makes the heart more mournful then converting grace. See <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Can that condition be ſo very joyful, which makes the heart ſo exceeding mournful? 4. We ſee no perſons walk more uncomfortably then (at leaſt) ſome converted perſons: Yet the eſtate is joyful, though the man is not alwayes ſo; God is a God of comfort, and they can pray for comfort; comfort, O Lord, thy ſervants ſoul! But more fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. No perſons are ſo expoſed to afflictions and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as converted perſons, and theſe do deprive us of joy and <note place="margin">How can this condition be joyful that is ſo expoſed to affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s I anſwer, 1. It is a truth that Converſion doth expoſe a perſon to moſt afflictions and perſecutions; <hi>Many are the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the righteous,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 34. 19. <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 12. <hi>Filii lucis,</hi> are <hi>Filii crucis,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> is <hi>Crucianus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) In the World you ſhall have troubles</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>and the Diſciple is not above his Maſter;</hi> if the Maſter dyed upon the Croſs, is it much that the Diſciple take up the Croſs? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in the ſecond place, as it was emblem'd in Reverend <hi>Hoopers</hi> Motto, There was a Lamb in a flaming Buſh, with the Sun ſhining upon it; or as it was with the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though they were in a fiery Furnace, yet the Son of God walked with them, and preſerved them: So, though converted perſons meet with many afflictions, there is yet a ſpring of joy, a Sun of comfort open unto them; therefore heed me.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Afflictions and perſecutions do only take away the Chriſtians outward comforts:</hi> The Shell, not the Kernel; the Caſe, not the <note place="margin">Afflictions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take away their outward comforts.</note> Jewel (which neither make nor marr the joy and comfort of a converted perſon) they do not take away the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of comfort. There are three ſorts of comforts; <hi>Senſual;</hi> which are drawn out of our ſinful luſts; Converſion is an enemy to theſe: <hi>Senſitive;</hi> which are drawn out of the creatures; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an enemy to theſe: <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which are drawn out of the favour of God, the blood of Chriſt, the Teſtimony of a good conſcience; afflictions cannot hinder theſe, and only a ſinful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converſion is an enemy to theſe: The Winter freezeth up the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115664:177"/> Ponds, but not the Ocean; the winds blow out the Candle, but not the Sun: An Unconverted man may have an exemption from all outward Afflictions, and yet have no inward Joy; for although he hath peace with men, yet he hath no peace with God; and although he hath no trouble upon his Eſtate, yet he may have terror upon his Conſcience. But a Converted man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be compaſſed with outward Sorrows, nevertheleſs he hath inward Joy; though all the Candles be blown out, yet I am Comforted as long as the Sun doth ſhine. There are two ſorts of evils; there are <hi>mala triſtia, &amp; mala turpia:</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are only Sorrowful evils as to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſenſe, they are not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evils as to our conſcience. Now no evil is able to take away ſpiritual comfort, unleſs it be a ſinfull evil; I confeſs, that did a godly man look upon creature comforts as his <hi>bonum ultimum,</hi> as that which made him happy, then afflictions would be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his joy, he might well cry out, as <hi>Micah</hi> once, <hi>Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</hi> But he doth not ſo: It is not the Creature, but the Creator, which is the foundation of his Happineſs and joy. A man may be Bad who hath them, and Good who wants them: <hi>If we had hope only in this life</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) <hi>we were of all men the moſt miſerable.</hi> I wiſh that you would or could give credit unto two things, one is, That that only makes the eſtate comfortable which denominates it to be good; for nothing can be truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, but what is truly good. The other is, That there is a greater power in the preſence of the chiefeſt good to make the Soul joyful, then there can be in the receſs or abſence of the leaſt kind of good to make it uncomfortable. Were Afflictions the greateſt evils, and were Creatures the beſt good, then joy could not conſiſt with afflictions; but God is the chiefeſt good, and the Chriſtian enjoyes him under all afflictions as his inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good; <hi>Ergo.</hi> 2. As Afflictions do not take off the <note place="margin">Times of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are his moſt proper ſeaſons for joy</note> Chriſtians true joy, <hi>ſo the times of afflictions are oft times the moſt proper ſeaſons for joy and comfort to his ſoul.</hi> There are three ſeaſons of ſpecial comforts which God is pleaſed to reſerve for his ſervants, one is <hi>after great temptations,</hi> or to prepare againſt them; as that Voice, <hi>This is my well beloved Son,</hi> came to Chriſt immediately before his temptation. The ſecond is, <hi>after
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115664:178"/> great Humiliations.</hi> God who <hi>comforts them that are caſt down,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 6. The Angel comforted Chriſt after his Agony; the Cordial comes after the Phyſick. The third is, before and under great afflictions and tryals: <hi>Paul</hi> was to appear before <hi>Nero,</hi> but firſt <hi>God appeared to him ſaying, Be of good cheer</hi> Paul. <hi>He is come, he is come,</hi> ſaid the Martyr when he ſaw the ſtake; and <hi>Stephen ſaw heaven opened</hi> before he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The comforts of heaven came into his heart juſt before the ſtones were thrown at him to daſh out his brains. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3. Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies and God of all comforts, who comforteth us in all our tribulations; for as our ſufferings abound, ſo our Conſolation aboundeth through Chriſt.</hi> Is not the night a ſeaſon to light a Candle? and is not weakneſs the ſeaſon to give a Cordial? and is not the winter a ſeaſon to make a Fire? When doth or can the Chriſtian more need the comforts of God, then when all comforts on earth do fail him? 3. As afflictions deprive not the Chriſtian of the true principles of Joy, <hi>ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Afflictions cannot hinder his principles of Joy from acting in a way of comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>can they hinder thoſe principles in himſelf from acting in a way of comfort.</hi> There are two principles (eſpecially) in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian which enable him to joy and comfort: One is <hi>Faith:</hi> It is ſtill Day, and never Night with Faith; the Star ſhines beſt in the night; <hi>(Believing ye rejoyced with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8.) Now Faith can act very comfortably in uncomfortable times; it can ſee the ſame God, with the ſame Love, and in the ſame Covenant, and in the ſame Relation, in Adverſity as in Proſperity: <hi>Hab. 3. 17. Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, &amp;c. yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5. 3. <hi>And not only ſo, but we glory in tribulation, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Sam. 29. 6 the people ſpake of ſtoning him, <hi>but David encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Rom. 8. 35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? &amp;c.</hi> If even in afflictions I can go unto the ſame armes of Chriſt, and unto the ſame breſts of divine Love, and into the ſame chamber of Preſence; if I can look upon God as my God, and ſee him to be my Father, that I can make known my heart to him, and he can make known his favour to me, what ſhould hinder me now to be joyful, who ſtill do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him who (alone) makes all my joy? Another is, the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115664:178"/> 
                  <hi>Testimony of Conſcience:</hi> This is the Friend in adverſity. <hi>This is our rejoycing, even the testimony of our Conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. Conſcience is a mans night or day, his Hell or Heaven, his Palace of delight or Jail of bitterneſs: If Conſcience be ſanctified or pacified, it can ſpeak a peace or joy that none can cruſh; none can hinder, but under the greateſt afflictions and perſecutions a converted man may and doth enjoy the teſtimony of a good Conſcience: <hi>Thou art upright,</hi> ſaith Conſcience to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> on his ſick-bed; <hi>Thou fearest God,</hi> ſaith Conſcience to <hi>Job</hi> under the loſs of all; <hi>Thou lovest Christ,</hi> ſaith Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Paul,</hi> even in the Priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Now to the ſecond Objection, That converting <note place="margin">But converſion brings us into a narrow path, it is an enemy to many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</note> Grace brings the perſon into a narrow path, and under the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt rules, even ſuch as condemn a multitude of joys and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; how can that condition be ſo joyfull, which denies and abridgeth, <hi>&amp;c? Sol.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is granted, That converting Grace brings the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Anſwered. There is a ſtrictneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> a very narrow path, and under very ſtrict rules. A converted man muſt not walk as other men; he muſt not allow himſelf to think, and deſire, and love, and ſpeak, and act as formerly: He muſt fear to ſin, he muſt love the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might; he muſt order his ſteps by the Word of God; he muſt deny himſelf, and crucifie his deareſt luſts, and not ſhun the hardeſt duty, nor delight in the leaſt iniquity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then, <hi>This ſtrictneſs is no adverſary to his true joy. In</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This ſtrictneſs is no adverſary to true joy.</note> 
                  <hi>keeping of thy commandments there is great reward,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal. 19. 11. Great peace have they who love thy law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy upon the Iſrael of God,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. I beſeech you to conſider four things: 1. <hi>Let thine own Conſcience judge, whether it be not a more comfortable courſe to obey God, then to diſobey God?</hi> to have grace to ſerve God acceptably, then to have an heart ſtill free and ready to diſhonour and provoke God? Who hath moſt true comfort, the bones ſound and in place, or broken? to walk on the Land, or to be troubled at Sea? the Child who runs away from his Father, or the Child who waits upon his Father? the Child that deſires to pleaſe, or the Child that continues to grieve and vex? the wandring and famiſhed Prodigal, or the returning
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115664:179"/> and embraced Son. <hi>Hoſ. 2. 7. I will return to my firſt Husband; for then it was better with me then now. 2. Rightly understand what it is ſtrictly to walk with God:</hi> It is an endeavour in your affections and duties to draw near to God in all well-pleaſing, and to anſwer the will of God. The Chriſtians courſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is his daily communion with his God in this life: When thou prayeſt, what is Praying, but a divine conference of the ſoul with God? and when thou heareſt, what is this but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conference of God with the ſoul? and when thou repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, what is that but a recovery and return of the ſoul to God? and when thou believeſt, what is that but the recumbency of the ſoul on the goodneſs of God? and when thou receiveſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what is it, but a communion, a feaſting with Jeſus Chriſt? If a ſtrict walking be nothing but a divine and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, why doeſt thou, how dareſt thou to judge of it as the onely Bar to ſhut out all joy and comfort? Was there ever any affectionate Wife, that thought it an injury to her Joy to ſpeak with her Husband, or to enjoy the ſociety of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? Was there ever any faithfull Friend, who thought it a miſery, a burthen to enjoy the ſociety of his Friends, to open his heart unto his Friend? How then can it be a prejudice to any mans joy, to enjoy communion with his God? 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with experience,</hi> which hath travelled in the ſtrict ways of God; either thine own experience, (if any,) which day of thy life hath been cloſed up with heartieſt joy? whether the day of licentiouſneſs, or the day of ſtrictneſs? That day which thou haſt let out to thy luſts, hath made the night a trembling to thee; that day which thou haſt redeemed for walking with God, hath always given unto thee the ſweeteſt reſt and repoſe at night: The experience of godly people; have any of them ever found more ſoul rejoycing then when they have abounded in ſtricteſt obedience? This is thy burthen, but it is their delight; the pureſt walking hath diſtilled the ſweeteſt joy, and their looſer walking hath been the cauſe of their greateſt ſorrows. It is with a ſtrict Chriſtian as with the Sun, which ſtill keeps to the Ecliptique Line, and is of all the Stars the moſt glorious and comfortable when it is at the higheſt; and the higher Sun, the purer and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er light: And it is with the looſe Chriſtian as with the uneven foot, the wry ſtepping is the cauſe of unjoynting, or pinching and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115664:179"/> paining. 4. <hi>The ſtrict walking,</hi> what is it but <hi>a path to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life?</hi> every ſtep of it is a ſtep to heaven. <hi>Strait is the gate which leads unto life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: There is an eaſie way for men to walk in, but thats the way to hell, and what comfort is it, after all to go to hell, to go to hell with eaſe. There is a ſtrict way for men to walk in, but it is the way to life, to eternal life: Now even that alone is ſufficient to create joy, that theſe ſteps after a while will bring me to appear before the God of Gods in Sion; and truly, there is no end whatſoever, the which if it be (in it ſelf) amiable and comfortable, but it darts alſo an amiableneſs and comfortableneſs upon all the ſteps and paths which tend unto it.</p>
               <p>3. Laſtly, <hi>Converting Grace doth not condemn or deny any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Converting grace denies not any lawfull joy.</note> 
                  <hi>joy and comfort:</hi> It doth onely two things; 1. It abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely condemns and abridgeth the ſoul of man of all ſinfull joys, of joys and delights which ariſe from his ſinfull luſts and ways; and is it not the great goodneſs of God, to deny us leave to drink cups of poiſon, and glaſſes of hell? Or is it poſſible that any Chriſtian ſhould to thee, that ſin ſhould be thy delight, which is a departing of the poor ſoul from God, which is an incenſing of the wrath of God, which was ſuch a dreadfull burthen to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, which puts the ſoul under the wrath and curſe of God; one act whereof muſt coſt more then all the world is worth to pardon it. 2. It doth onely order our outward lawfull joys and delights, for the ſeaſons, for the meaſures, for other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; ſo that they may be our ſauce, not our food; our helps to Godlineſs, not damps thereto: It is but the Bridle on the Horſe, the Pale for the Garden, the Finger on the Dial.

Converſion breeds the quickeſt ſenſe of ſin, and the deepeſt mourning for ſin, yea, a continual mourning for ſin, makes the clouds to drop, never mournfull till converted; and can that condition be ſo joyfull which makes the heart ſo mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. It is certain, that true grace 1. doth make <hi>the clearest diſcovery of ſin: 2. It yields the tenderest ſenſe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115664:180"/> of ſin,</hi> (for it takes away the heart of ſtone, and gives an heart of fleſh,) and nothing makes the heart more mournfull, then true grace.</p>
               <p>2. But then know, that <hi>mourning for ſin and joy in the heart are no way inconſistent.</hi> Iſai 12. 3. <hi>With joy ſhall ye draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  <hi>out of the wells of ſalvation.</hi> Three things I would grant, 1. That love of ſin and true joy are inconſiſtent; 2. Worldly ſorrow and ſpiritual joy are inconſiſtent; 3. That terrour for ſin and joy of heart are inconſiſtent; Legal terrour and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical joy are ſo, but Evangelical ſorrow and Evangelical joy are not ſo; for as one grace is conſiſtent with another grace, ſo one heavenly affection is conſiſtent with another heavenly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And there are three things which (to me) fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, That Evangelical mourning is conſiſtent with Spiritual joy: One is, That ſuch a mourning is but a drop out of the eye of faith; <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. and certainly, nothing comes from faith, but what is comfortable; all is Goſpel that Faith trades in. Another is, That the mourning heart is a renewed heart, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the gracious heart is a joyous heart. The third is, That the mourning ſinner is a pardoned ſinner: <hi>(Cum intueor flentem, ſentis ignoſcibilem,)</hi> if the fountain of ſorrow be ſet open in the heart, the fountain of mercy is ſet open in heaven, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. compared with chap. 13. 1. Yea let me add to this alſo three experiences: 1. One is this, <hi>That the Christian is never more ſad and mournfull, then when he feels his heart least mournfull:</hi> He is then caſt down; O (ſaith he) into what a condition am I brought? I was wont to find a tender, ſenſible mourning ſpirit; but me thinks now my heart is grown hard again: O Lord, why am I now hardened from thy fear? And the man never gives over with God and himſelf, until tenderneſs be renewed in his heart again. 2. <hi>That the Christian is never more joyfull, then when he is most mournfull: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that ſow beſides all Waters,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Godly ſorrow is the Water that is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Wine; One drop of a guilty Conſcience is able to turn all our Joyes into Bitterneſs, and one drop of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115664:180"/> godly ſorrow is able to turn all our bitterneſs into joy. <hi>I rejoyce,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>that I made you ſorry;</hi> what cauſe then had they to rejoyce who were ſorry? <hi>ſorry after a godly ſort;</hi> ſorry with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that bred repentance unto ſalvation, never to be repented of. 3. <hi>That the Chriſtian is never more mournful then when he is moſt joyful:</hi> The time of a Chriſtians higheſt joy, is the time of his greateſt aſſurance: Sealing and aſſuring times are the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſing and reviving times. And the times of greateſt aſſurance, are the times of our greateſt mournings: The more manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Love, and the more aſſurance of Gods Mercy, do ever cauſe in the heart more Humility and more ſorrow; here is now the greateſt joy for mercy, and here is now the greateſt mourning for ſinning againſt mercy.</p>

Me thinks the terrible paſſages in Scripture may abundantly convince us of the dreadfulneſs of an Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and wicked perſon, Iſa. 57. 20. <hi>The wicked are like the raging ſea that cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> Job 20. 16, 17, 23, 24, 25. there <hi>Zophar</hi> ſets him out: <hi>He ſhall ſuck the gall of Aſps, and the Vipers tongue ſhall ſlay him. He ſhall not ſee the Rivers, nor the floods and ſtreams of Honey and Butter. When he is about to fill his belly, God ſhall ſend upon him the fierceneſs of his wrath, and ſhall cauſe it to rain upon him. The bow of Steel ſhall ſtrike him through, the gliſtring ſword cometh out of his gall, terrors are upon him.</hi> Pſal. 11. 6. <hi>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115664:181"/> as <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> did? But take the hardeſt agonies incident to true converts, they are 1. rather fears then horrours; 2. rather doubts then deſpairs; 3. effects of a miſtaking Conſcience, then a rightly condemning Conſcience; 4. They can look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Promiſes, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did in the deeps towards God; 5. Faith doth doth act for relief, and will hold ſome communion with God; 6. They are abated by the Ordinances; 7. They are but for a time; 8. They end in fulleſt ſetling and glorious comforts, and likewiſe with advantage to their gracious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And truly, it is impoſſible that wicked and ungodly men ſhould ever enjoy that ſerenity and peace as the godly do, for as much as all the principles and cauſes of uncomfortableneſs abide on the wicked. 1. <hi>Sin is in them in all its ſtrength:</hi> They have a thouſand hells and arrows of guilt ſticking in their hearts; they have ſouls full of plague ſores, the deadly ſtrokes of death, the reſtleſs motions of evil ſpirits. 2. <hi>They carry a roaring Lion in their brests;</hi> I mean, an evil, accuſing, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wounding, racking, condemning Conſcience; which if it once awake, it will tear the caul of their hearts, and cruſh them with the flames of unavoidable, unſupportable and continual wrath. 3. <hi>They have no City of Refuge open to their ſuccour,</hi> no land or ſhore, no place to caſt anchor, no portion in Chriſt; and therefore the Law of God ſtands in full force againſt their ſouls, and under its curſe they lie, and at that Bar of Juſtice muſt they be tried. 4. <hi>They end in an éternal and perfect Hell.</hi> 5. Take them at their beſt, <hi>God is their Enemy,</hi> (they never yet made peace with him,) <hi>and all their outward bleſſings are ſteeped in gall, and drenched in Wormwood;</hi> as their ſorrows, ſo their bleſſings are diſtributed in wrath.</p>

Suppoſe that thou rejoyceſt not in a fine Baby, and a Toy, which is a Childs great delight, art thou therefore ſad? All objects yield not contentment to an high mind, nor joy to a good man; he cannot take pleaſure in an Alehouſe and Tavern, in ſwaggering and masking, in dicing
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115664:181"/> and carding, and ſwearing, and whoring; but yet he can take delight in a reconciled God, in a Chriſt, in the Word of God, in praying to God, in gracious returnes from God, in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Glory of God. A ſwine delights in mire, but a man doth not. The Moon is oft times dark to the world, when yet that part which faceth to the Sun is beautiful and lightſome: The countenance and carriage of a Chriſtian, as to the world, ſeems dull and uncomfortable, but if you could look into the heart of him (which faceth towards heaven) O there is Righteouſneſs, there is Peace, there is Joy in the Holy Ghoſt!</p>

Take heed of ſetling your ſouls, or reſting your ſouls on any works, or any affections which are antecedent to converſion, even the ſorrows and troubles before converſion are no matter of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; if any joy depends on them, it is rather becauſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath followed them; and the joys which many men take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their converſion, certainly they are falſe joys, poor joys, they are not pleaſures of Gods right hand.

Now the life of faith, 1. <hi>Eaſeth you of all your burthens:</hi> There are but two burthens upon us; 1. The <hi>ſinfull,</hi> Faith ſees this taken off by Chriſt, <hi>He bare our ſins:</hi> 2. The <hi>earthly,</hi> of cares; Faith ſees Gods providence taking that off, <hi>The Lord is a Sun,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 84. I will never leave thee, Heb. 13. Bread ſhall be given to him, his waters ſhall be ſure, Iſa. 33. 16. Cast your care on him, for he careth for you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. 2. <hi>Secures you against all prejudices and hurts:</hi> Faith finds us ſtill in Gods hands, and in a ſafe cuſtody: Though there be evils in the world, yet they ſhall not come nigh you; and his work goes on, though ours do not: God is with you, who can be againſt you. There's a Deluge, but <hi>Noah</hi>'s in the Ark; a ſtorm, but you are in an hiding place: He holds you in his hand, and covers you under his wings; makes all things to work for good. Faith ſees the Trouble and the Sanctuary both, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences and Providence both, ruling, carrying on, obſerving, watching, preſerving: If Earth won't keep you ſafe, Heaven ſhall. 3. <hi>It renders the preſent poſſeſſion as good, and enough:</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:115664:187"/> Your portion is ſo: For what is a Chriſtians portion? Is not God? is not his favour?

Know then, 1. <hi>The great Fountain of thy Joy lies more in thy Juſtification then in thy Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> Thou haſt not ſo much Holineſs as another, but thou haſt of Chriſts Righteouſneſs; thou canſt not apprehend ſo ſtrongly, but thou art apprehended as ſtrongly, Chriſt lays as faſt hold of thee. 2. <hi>That Grace and Weakneſs may dwell together.</hi> It may be very true, though very weak, <hi>the ſmoaking flax,</hi> and <hi>the bruiſed reed,</hi> and the <hi>grain of muſtard-ſeed;</hi> A Father hath one Child in the Cradle, and another in the Shop; a Shepheard hath Lambs in the flock, as well as Sheep; the Gardiner hath Plants, as well as Trees; and Chriſt hath Babes, as well as ſtrong Men, belonging to him. 3. <hi>That the least Grace, and the great Love of God do go together:</hi> The little drop of Grace comes out of the Ocean of his great Love; the Peny, as well as the Shilling, bears the Superſcription. 4. <hi>That the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true Grace denominates the condition to be converted:</hi> I would believe, is Faith; I would love thee, is Love; I deſire to do thy will, is Obedience: Not Strength, but Truth denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates. 5. <hi>True Grace and many Conflicts go together:</hi> Let the motions of ſin be never ſo vile, but I hate them; never ſo many, but I reſiſt them; here Grace is the Lord which rules me,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115664:188"/> though ſin be the Enemy which moleſts me. Why am I thus? Alas, there are contraries in thee, Light and Darkneſs, Fleſh and Spirit. 6. <hi>True Grace and ſome Failings may lodge toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> I may at the ſame time be a Captive to Sin, and yet a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to Grace; ſin may ſometimes be too ſtrong even for him who hates ſin. 7. <hi>All ſervices to God are interpreted and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God according to the will of a converted perſon:</hi> Although thou canſt not pray ſo freely, ſo fully, ſo uniformly, yet if God ſee a will in thee deſirous ſo to do, it ſhall paſs for currant; groans, and ſighs, and chatterings, and deſires, and tears, <hi>&amp;c. 8. Thou never doeſt any Duty, but Jeſus Chriſt gives acceptance unto it by his Interceſſion;</hi> his ſweet Incenſe takes off the ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: The greateſt work done by thee, if it comes in thy own name, is rejected; the weakeſt, if preſented in his Name, a ſigh or groan, is graciouſly accepted; as the Sacrifices by the Prieſt. 9. <hi>God never expects thou ſhouldeſt buy out thy own pardon,</hi> or bring from thy ſelf any ſatisfaction for any of thy ſins; he hath deſigned that work onely to Jeſus Chriſt, in whom he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thee, and for whoſe ſake alone he doth and will diſcharge thee: You trade in Heaven upon gracious terms; when you come for any grace and help, thy Reaſons and Motives are in God, who gives, and freely gives. 10. <hi>As ſoon as ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace prevails upon thy heart, Salvation is come to thy ſoul:</hi> Thou art now a Believet; and if a Believer, a Son; and if a Son, an Heir of all the comfortable Promiſes now, and a Co-heir with Chriſt hereafter. 11. <hi>The Lord will bleſs thy buds, and increaſe thy ſtock of Grace:</hi> He will water, as well as plant it. 12. <hi>That little Grace ſhall never fail thee,</hi> never leave thee, till it brings thee to Heaven: The greateſt Grace is imperfect, and the leaſt Grace is invincible; the greateſt Grace is weak, and the weakeſt Grace is immortal.</p>
               <p>Now if Chriſtians did believe all theſe Truths, and would conſider of them, would not their condition be more joyfull? Here's a Weakneſs, I but it is Grace; that Grace is little, I but it comes from Graciouſneſs, and makes me gracious: O how many conflicts! I but 'tis 'twixt Grace and Sin; yea, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnings, I but not love of ſin, no voluntary ſervice: But how poor in Duties! I but God regards the Will: But what will
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115664:188"/> become of me for my former ſins? Why! Chriſt hath ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God hath pardoned: But if I had ſtrength of Grace, I might take comfort; Why! the weakeſt Convert is a Believer, and the weakeſt Believer hath Chriſt; <hi>Ergò.</hi>
