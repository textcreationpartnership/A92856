         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Herein, the Sinners <hi>Aver≈øion</hi> from God, <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion</hi> to God, and his <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God, are profitably unfolded &amp; applied. Helps in the≈øe ≈øeveral Subjects, are well worth every Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans welcome; and time ≈øeriou≈øly ≈øpent in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing ≈øuch Di≈øcour≈øes, will not be labor in vain. <hi>Adam,</hi> by for≈øaking God, lo≈øt his primitive Glory, which cannot po≈ø≈øibly be repaired in his Po≈øterity, but by returning to his Maje≈øty-Man cometh into the World with his Back towards Heaven, and with ≈øtrong Antipathies again≈øt God; yea, his con≈øtant cour≈øe of life is a departing from the Lord, till his Highne≈øs by Omnipotent Grace doth change both his Heart and Way. And when the ≈øecure Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is well awakened to con≈øider his wofull Apo≈øtacy, attended with the ≈øad Con≈øequents thereof, together with the impo≈ø≈øibility of
<pb facs="tcp:115664:3"/> all Creature ≈øoccours to relieve him, then, and not till then, doth he ≈øeriou≈øly think of facing about towards God, whom he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted with inexcu≈øable neglect and di≈øhonor.</p>
            <p>Now the ≈øelf condemning Convict, in this dolefull condition, upon frequent ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflexions, &amp; aggravating his woful Apo≈øtacy, doth find it very difficult to hold up hope of gaining re-admi≈ø≈øion into the favor of ≈ølight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; for≈øaken Deity. This poor <hi>Spira</hi> did expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as his tears, his torments, together with his de≈øponding, de≈øpairing language doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate. But in this pitifull plight, the ≈øinking ≈øoul may receive ≈øtrong ≈øupports, by con≈øidering, with application, what loving Entertainment the guilty, worthle≈øs Prodigal received from his offended, for≈øaken Father.

               <p>THis Chapter con≈øi≈øts of three Parables, all of them tending to one ≈øcope and i≈ø≈øue, though di≈øtinct in their ≈øpecial matter and object. The fir≈øt Parable is of <hi>a Sheep,</hi> from <hi>ver≈ø. 4.</hi> to <hi>ver≈ø. 8.</hi> The ≈øecond of <hi>a piece of Silver,</hi> from <hi>ver≈ø. 8.</hi> to <hi>ver≈ø. 11.</hi> The third of <hi>a Child,</hi> from <hi>ver≈ø. 11.</hi> to the end.</p>
               <p>All of the≈øe agree in two conditions; One, of <hi>Lo≈øs,</hi> the Sheep was lo≈øt, the Groat was lo≈øt, and the Child was lo≈øt: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115664:6"/> of <hi>Recovery;</hi> the Sheep that wandred, is brought home; the Groat which was lo≈øt, is found out; and the Son who depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is returned and accepted. There be who undertake the <note place="margin">Cyril</note> Rea≈øons of the≈øe Parables or dark ≈øimilitudes, under which Chri≈øt doth couch ≈øome ≈øpecial Le≈ø≈øon; as, why man is compared to a <hi>Sheep, viz.</hi> becau≈øe of our Creation, wherein <hi>God made us, and not we our ≈øelves; we are the ≈øheep of his pa≈øture.</hi> P≈øal. 100. And why man is then compared to a <hi>Groat;</hi> becau≈øe of that ≈øingular image of God which was ≈øtamped in man at his creation; as the royal image of a King is ≈øtamped upon ≈øuch a piece of Coin. And then, why man is compared to a <hi>Son;</hi> becau≈øe of that near relation which he had to God, being once able to call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And then, why in every one of the≈øe, to a <hi>lo≈øt</hi> Sheep, a <hi>lo≈øt</hi> Groat, a <hi>lo≈øt</hi> Son, becau≈øe of his revolt and departure from God by ≈øin: Nay, and if it were lawfull to put and u≈øe free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits on Parables, (as I am ≈øure ≈øome of the Ancients do, as St. <hi>Au≈øtin, Gregory,</hi> &amp;c.) what if in this threefold Parable, you might e≈øpie a threefold cau≈øe of mans fall. "In the ≈øheep wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, <hi>Satans ≈øugge≈øtion;</hi> "In the Groat lo≈øt by the woman, <hi>the womans yielding;</hi> "In the Sons departing, <hi>Adams voluntary revolting,</hi> and ≈øpending of his happy e≈øtate and condition. But the≈øe and ≈øuch like ob≈øervations, though to ≈øome they ≈øeem more acute and plea≈øant, yet to me they are frothy and unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Touching the Parable therefore, concerning which I am to <note place="margin">The Scope of the Parable, with a divi≈øion of the chief Heads thereof.

Concerning the <hi>Father</hi> of the two Sons, they all agree; but about the <hi>two Sons,</hi> they differ. Some by the two Sons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> The <hi>Angels,</hi> they were the elder Son; <hi>Man</hi> the younger, being created after them. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels abode at home with their Father, Man had the ≈øtock put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, and in a quick time lo≈øt him≈øelf and it. This opinion you ≈øee hath ≈øome kind of Vicinity or corre≈øpondency; <hi>≈øen≈øus pius</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ≈øpeaks of it) but not <hi>proprius.</hi> And there is one pregnant Rea≈øon again≈øt it in the Text; for that the elder Son in this place, is de≈øcribed to be grieved and ≈øad at the acclamations and welcome te≈øtimonies of the younger Brothers return; but the Angels <hi>rejoice</hi> and are glad at <hi>the conver≈øion</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <hi>of a ≈øinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115664:6"/>
               <p>2. Others by the two Sons under≈øtand the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were the elder, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the younger; the <hi>Jews</hi> kept home, as it were; of all the Nations of the Earth, they ≈øeemed to be the inclo≈øure for God and his ≈øervice; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were as it were excluded, rejected, wandring ≈øheep, a lo≈øt people; yet at length God through Chri≈øt looks after the≈øe lo≈øt ≈øheep, <hi>(the other ≈øheep of his fold,</hi> as Chri≈øt ≈øpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.) and returns and accepts of the Gentiles, which did much <hi>provoke the Jew,</hi> (as the elder Son was here provoked at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and acceptance of the younger, and kept out.) they were <hi>provoked to jealou≈øie</hi> by tho≈øe who once were not a people. This interpretation plea≈øeth S. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> and ≈øome others; and indeed it bears a fair congruity with the Parable in mo≈øt re≈øpects.</p>
               <p>3. But the third and general opinion is, that <hi>by the elder Son</hi> is meant the <hi>Scribes and Phari≈øees,</hi> (and under them any Ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries) per≈øons too conceited and confident of their own works, ≈øervice, righteou≈øne≈øs, as this elder Son who had been (as he ≈øaid) <hi>thus long in his Fathers hou≈øe and never tran≈øgra≈ø≈øed any of his Commandments,</hi> but ≈øerved him carefully; which indeed was the opinion of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari≈øees,</hi> who <hi>tru≈øted to</hi> and <hi>boa≈øted of their own righteou≈øne≈øs:</hi> And that by the <hi>younger Son</hi> is meant the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> per≈øons more notoriou≈øly riotous and infamous in ≈øinning, utterly for≈øaking of God, as it were, and living without him. And the end of this Parable was to convince the proud and envious <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari≈øees,</hi> (who in <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 1. and 2. of this Chapter, <hi>murmured again≈øt Chri≈øt</hi> for <hi>receiving Publicans and Sinners:)</hi> Now Chri≈øt tells them, that though the≈øe notorious ≈øinners were de≈øpi≈øed by them, yet he <hi>came to call them to repentance,</hi> and that God would be mo≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgent and gracious to them; though they had been great tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra≈ø≈øors, yet now being penitent, he would receive them into ≈øingular mercy and favour, and that with much joy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little rea≈øon had they to ≈ønarl at his re≈øpect and de≈øires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Publicans and great ≈øinners. Thus for the ≈øcope of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which is, <hi>To declare the ≈øingular readine≈øs of God in and through Chri≈øt, even to receive the mo≈øt notorious ≈øinners, proving penitent.</hi>

               <p>Now the Parable con≈øi≈øts, or rather comprehends two e≈øtates <note place="margin">The parts of the Parable.</note> of the Prodigal Son.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> where are con≈øiderable, 1. The <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion</hi> of it, <hi>v. 12.

Now whether this ≈øub≈øtance were tho≈øe good Qualities in Creation, or good Gifts of mind or e≈øtate afterward, it is ≈øomewhat di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; upon which I ≈øhall con≈øider in its time and place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The event of it:</hi> That e≈øtate being ≈øpent, he bethinks of an other cour≈øe; indeed, now he ≈øhould have thought of coming back to his Father, but he did not; nay, he tries all conclu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before he re≈øolves on that: Therefore again ob≈øerve, upon the Lo≈øs and con≈øumption of his E≈øtate,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, his <hi>earthly policy, He joyns him≈øelf with a Citizen of that Countrey,</hi> v. 15. By whom ≈øome under≈øtand the Devil; ≈øo S. <hi>Ambro≈øe, Civis i≈øte e≈øt i≈øtius mundi Princeps.</hi> Others, ≈øome kind of earthly or worldly employment: But being joyned with him, his ≈øervice is ≈øordid, for he is ≈øent <hi>into the fields</hi> (no hou≈øe ≈øhall hold him who for≈øakes Gods hou≈øe) <hi>to feed the ≈øwine;</hi> he is made a ≈øervant of the na≈øtie≈øt bea≈øt, who would not continue the ≈øervant of the be≈øt Father and God. Secondly, his <hi>extreme mi≈øery;</hi> this ≈øhift did no way help him: Nothing ≈øupplies, when God for≈øakes; and no way is comfortable, when we prove ≈øinfull. <hi>He would fain have filled his belly with the husks which the ≈øwine did eat, and no man gave him to eat.</hi> v. 15. Ah, what a change doth ≈øin make! Here is one, whiles he continued with his Father, enjoyed excellent ≈øociety, tender love, compleat plenty; but now for≈øaking his Father, he keeps company with the ≈øwine, is extremely pinched with hunger, glad would he have been ≈øerved after the very hogs, and no man regarded him in this mi≈øery and want; ≈øo that now there is a lo≈øs of all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs, and a certainty of fami≈øhing and peri≈øhing, if he returns not, and hereupon comes forth.</p>
               <p n="2">The ≈øecond e≈øtate of him, which was of <hi>his Conver≈øion and Penitency:</hi> Where you have three things ob≈øervable.</p>

Surely if my father hath bread enough for ≈øervants, he will have ≈øome for a child; and if he hath to ≈øpare for hired ≈øervants, he will have ≈øome to ≈øpare for a fami≈øhing child.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conver≈øion,</hi> to return to his father <hi>[and go to my father].</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Confe≈ø≈øion,</hi> to acknowledge 1 His ≈øin. 2. His unworthine≈øs.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Supplication;</hi> to intreat his Father, that yet he would look upon him, and own him, and accept of him.</p>

This is the literal part of the Parable: But the Moral part comprehends (if I mi≈øtake not) the≈øe Propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Sin is a departing from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Prodigal, he mu≈øt leave his Father, he mu≈øt be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>D.</hi> 1. Sin is a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God</note> gone, what doth it imply, but the ≈øinner is a departer? Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is a departing; we leave God when we betake our ≈øelves to a cour≈øe of ≈øinning. Thus is it ≈øtiled in Scripture, <hi>E≈øai.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Ah ≈øinfull Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ≈øeed of evil doers, children that are corrupters; they have for≈øaken the Lord, they have gone away backward.</hi> Here ≈øin is called a for≈øaking the Lord, and a going away, and a revolting, <hi>ye will revolt more and more:</hi> which is a falling off untru≈øtily from God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>They have for≈øaken me the fountain of living waters.</hi> Heb. 3. 12. <hi>An evil he art of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a two-fold Departing; One is <hi>real,</hi> when he turns away from the place or pre≈øence of another, as <hi>Jonathan aro≈øe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A two-fold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting. Real.</note> 
                  <hi>and departed from his father Saul.</hi> Thus no man can depart from God; for he being omnipre≈øent, is with us in every place: Another is <hi>moral,</hi> which is, when the heart or ≈øoul departs; and thus the ≈øinner departs from God, when his ≈øoul and affections leave him, <note place="margin">Moral.</note> and cleave to ≈øin. And it cannot be but that ≈øinning ≈øhould be ≈øuch a departing, for as much as God and ≈øin are mo≈øt contrary, ≈øo that the ≈øoul cannot enjoy them both; if you will love and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your ≈øins, you mu≈øt leave God; and if you will love and follow the Lord, you mu≈øt leave your ≈øins; for <hi>what communion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115664:9"/> can there be betwixt light and darkne≈øs,</hi> God and ≈øin.</p>
               <p>The U≈øe of this may <hi>inform us</hi> of the <hi>madne≈øs and folly of a ≈øinner,</hi> He will live in ≈øuch or ≈øuch a ≈øin, and with greedine≈øs he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</hi> See the folly of the ≈øinner,</note> follows the inticements thereof: Well! thou enjoye≈øt thy ≈øin, but con≈øider that thou lo≈øe≈øt thy God; and what doe≈øt thou get in all thy delights, which are but <hi>lying vanities,</hi> while≈øt thou <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake≈øt the God of thy mercies?</hi> Thy exchange is mi≈øerable, to leave a God, and embrace a ≈øin; to depart from the chiefe≈øt good and happine≈øs, and to make choice of the ba≈øe≈øt objects of ≈øin, which is wor≈øe then hell it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>A ≈øecond moral ob≈øervation is this, that <hi>A ≈øinner doth volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, of his own accord, depart from God.</hi> Here the Prodigal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>D.</hi> 2. A ≈øinner doth voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God.</note> makes choice of his own way and cour≈øe, and de≈øires to be left to him≈øelf, and to take his own cour≈øe. God compels no man to a ≈øinfull cour≈øe, nor is he the cau≈øe thereof, nor can Satan compel the heart. A man in this regard is ≈øaid to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>entice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf,</hi> and with <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>≈øell him≈øelf to work wickedne≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, The <hi>≈øinner is utterly inexcu≈øable</hi> before God, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</hi> Therefore the ≈øinner is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øable.</note> his mouth is for ever ≈øtopped, his ≈øin and perdition is of him≈øelf. God is cleared in Judgment, who puni≈øhes the wicked who is the actor, contriver, and ≈øole cau≈øe of his own ≈øinnings. Take any ≈øinner who delights him≈øelf in a way of wickedne≈øs, why! he is voluntary in it: 'Tis true, in di≈øpute he pretends an in≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or inability, but the real cau≈øe of his ≈øinning is his own will, for he <hi>loves Darkne≈øs rather then Light,</hi> and had rather ≈øerve his Lu≈øts then God; he makes choice of them before God, as the multitude did of <hi>Barrabas</hi> before <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi> and when Life and Death, God and Sin are propounded, yea, and that with the true rewards from the one, and ≈øevere wrath from the other, yet he like <hi>I≈ø≈øachar bowes down under the burthen, and loves re≈øt;</hi> he had rather go on in his ≈øins, and will not leave them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alone are guilty of our own bloud, God is innocent as well as ju≈øt, our condemnation is but a due guerdon or paiment for our own voluntary departings from God.</p>
               <p>A third moral Ob≈øervation is this, that <hi>The plea≈øures of ≈øinning will quickly end, and the end of them is extreme mi≈øery.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The plea≈øures of ≈øin will quickly end in mi≈øery.</note> here will be gone, he mu≈øt have plea≈øure, his Fathers hou≈øe was too ≈øtrict; well, he begins his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iotous living, but then you read that he quickly con≈øumed and wa≈øted all his ≈øub≈øtance, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115664:10"/> brought him≈øelf into ≈øuch extreme nece≈ø≈øities, that he became a ≈øervant to the ≈øwine, and fain would have fed his belly with the husks which they left, but none gave unto him. This point I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more fully to pre≈øs, which contains in it two branches: 1. <hi>That the plea≈øures of ≈øinning are but ≈øhort. 2. That though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and plea≈øures begin a ≈øinfull cour≈øe, yet extreme nece≈ø≈øity and mi≈øery or ≈øtreights do end it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The plea≈øures and delights of ≈øinning are but ≈øhort:</hi> The rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous life of the Prodigal was a pre≈øent con≈øumption of his e≈øtate. <note place="margin">The plea≈øures of ≈øin are but ≈øhort.</note> The plea≈øure of ≈øin is like a Candle, which in the very burning and lighting burns and con≈øumes away. It is in Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the <hi>crackling of thorns,</hi> which is but a ≈øpeedy blaze; and to the Lightning, which is but a glance and a fla≈øh and away; and to a ≈øea≈øon, <hi>the plea≈øures of ≈øin for a ≈øea≈øon,</hi> Heb. 11. which is a very inch of time, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, a little article of time; for though time be long, yet a ≈øea≈øon is but a ≈øhort ≈øpace. In <hi>Job</hi> the plea≈øure of ≈øin is compared to <hi>a ≈øweet mor≈øel;</hi> a mor≈øel is no great quantity, and though it be ≈øweet, yet it ≈ølips quickly away from the tongue and palate. And the Apo≈øtle compares it to a <hi>bait</hi> wherewith a fi≈øh is taken; the fi≈øh looks on, and nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a little, and takes it down, and then away goes the bait. <hi>Cain</hi> plea≈øed him≈øelf a while, but not long; for the ≈øin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pre≈øently pur≈øued and cried again≈øt him: And <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, had but one ta≈øte of the forbidden tree, it quickly ≈øet his teeth on edge: <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s gold and garments, and <hi>Achan</hi>'s wedge, as they were ≈øtoln waters, and though ≈øweet, yet ≈øhort. So was it with <hi>Ahab,</hi> he got <hi>Naboths vineyard</hi> ≈øinfully, but he ≈øcarce ever enjoyed it; he met with a mighty cur≈øe from God pre≈øently upon him.</p>
               <p>But here ob≈øerve, that the plea≈øures of ≈øin may be ≈øaid to be <note place="margin">In re≈øpect of e≈øtimation.</note> ≈øhort, 1. In re≈øpect of <hi>e≈øtimation:</hi> when the hearts of men judge of them as fal≈øe, unlawfull, and ≈øhort. Thus <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> e≈øteemed of them, and therefore <hi>refu≈øed the plea≈øures of ≈øin, which were but for a ≈øea≈øon.</hi> 2. In re≈øpect of <hi>duration:</hi> For if Life it≈øelf be not long, <note place="margin">In re≈øpect of duration.</note> the plea≈øures of ≈øin mu≈øt needs be ≈øhort. It is true, that as long as the impenitent ≈øoul hath a being, the guilt of his ≈øin ≈øhall have a being and con≈øi≈øtence in the ≈øoul, but at the utmo≈øt ≈øinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures extend not beyond our life, their date then of nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt be expired, though u≈øually they are extingui≈øhed or interrupted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115664:10"/> before, and life is a very ≈øhort tale, hour, moment. 3. <hi>In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In compari≈øon with eternity.</note> 
                  <hi>with eternity;</hi> though a man ≈øhould live in the plea≈øures of ≈øin 20, 40, 60 years, yet what is that ≈øpace of time to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ≈øorrows and bitterne≈øs. Compare the longe≈øt time with eternity, it is ≈øcarce a con≈øiderable moment. But you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Why ≈øhould the plea≈øures of ≈øin be ≈øo ≈øhort? <hi>Sol.</hi> Nay <note place="margin">Rea≈øons of it.</note> you might rather demand, Why they ≈øhould be at all? for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed real plea≈øure cannot ari≈øe out of ≈øinful acts, yet a carnal and ≈øen≈øual plea≈øure there is, which is neverthele≈øs ≈øhort: Becau≈øe</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sin is never ≈øo plea≈øant, but it breeds that which is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sin is never ≈øo plea≈øant but it breeds that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øant.</note> 
                  <hi>unplea≈øant;</hi> nay the more plea≈øure we find in it, the more di≈øplea≈øure it works; like a draught of beer, which the more fully and plea≈øantly drops down, the more danger is added to the patient: So is it with ≈øin, it ≈øeems a delightful thing to you to follow your lu≈øts, your evil waies; but the more you ≈øin, the more you increa≈øe your guilt; and guilt is but a ≈øword to cut the throat of your ≈øinful plea≈øures; It is like ≈øweet poi≈øon, which goes down ea≈øily and delightfully, but it will ≈øuddenly di≈øturb and crack the body.</p>

And look as when a good man earne≈øtly pre≈ø≈øes God upon his promi≈øes, his ≈øorrowes ≈øhall not ≈øtay long, but ≈øighs and tears ≈øhall flie away: So when a wicked man provoketh God by his ≈øinnings, his plea≈øures ≈øhall be ≈øhort, for the Lord will perform his threatnings again≈øt him.</p>

               <p>But I proceed to the opening of the ≈øecond branch, <hi>viz. the endings of ≈øin.</hi> That though a ≈øinful cour≈øe may begin in many <note place="margin">Sin will end in many mi≈øeries.</note> plea≈øures, yet <hi>it ≈øhall end in many mi≈øeries, extremities, and ≈øtraits.</hi> There are diver≈øe ≈øorts of ending of things: ≈øome end by way of <hi>annihilation,</hi> as the ≈øouls of the bea≈øts, they ≈øhall cea≈øe to be, they are re≈øolved into nothing; ≈øome end by way of <hi>perfection,</hi> as the ≈øouls and waies of holy men, Glory and Salvation is their end; ≈øome end by way of <hi>corruption,</hi> as when the beauty of a thing is marred, or a goodly body is turned; and ends in a loath≈øome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka≈øs, or ≈øweet Wine turns to ≈øharp Vineger. After this manner doth ≈øin end, or a ≈øinful cour≈øe end: as it was with the day in which <hi>Sodom</hi> was de≈øtroied, it began with the <hi>plea≈øant light of the Sun,</hi> but it <hi>ended in fire and brim≈øtone:</hi> Thus was it with tho≈øe ≈øinners, their delightful flames of lu≈øt ended in horrid flames of Vengeance.

So we read of the I≈øraelites before the Captivity, how extremely they did endure a very ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Judgments, and variety of ≈øtrange puni≈øhments before they would return?

Now for the clearer opening of this A≈ø≈øertion, con≈øider of the≈øe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is to be under≈øtood of the natural temper of the ≈øinner.</hi> The ≈øinner may be con≈øidered two wayes under extremities: <hi>As</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This is to be under≈øtood of the natural temper of the ≈øinner.</note> 
                  <hi>effectually a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the preventing grace of God,</hi> which is of ≈øurpa≈ø≈øing vertue to renew the ≈øoul, and to conquer its ≈øtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and aver≈øne≈øs, and effectually to per≈øwade and draw in the heart to yield unto God, and to give up its weapons of lu≈øts. The which grace (if God infu≈øeth) at any time whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, or under, or after afflictions, then the ≈øinner doth not wander in the paths of perver≈øne≈øs, nor doth he hold out ≈øo long, but in ≈øtead of trying all ways to continue in his ≈øins, he will ≈øpeedily a≈ø≈øay all the ways to be freed from them. <hi>As left unto his own corrupt ≈øpirit,</hi> and the projects, contrivances and ways there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And thus it is with him, like a be≈øieged enemy, which will retreat from hold to hold, and di≈øpute every inch of ground, before he will give up the City: So is it with the ≈øinner, his heart will devi≈øe one defence after another, and he hath yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ≈øhift, though he be many times hardly be≈øet in his name, or in his e≈øtate, or in his body, yea, or in his con≈øcience. And God doth narrowly watch over him, and doth ≈øpoil him of his many fal≈øe confidences, and deals more ≈ømartingly with him to yield and return; yet he hath not onely much ≈øubtilty of ≈øpirit behind to delude all, but al≈øo he hath exceeding ≈øtubbornne≈øs of ≈øpirit to oppo≈øe all the means which are u≈øed for his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh of the ways whereby God doth deal with a ≈øinner;</hi> which are of two ≈øorts: Some are <hi>Victorious ways,</hi>

It is the ≈øtronger man di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing, and the ≈øtronger hand pulling us out of the powers of darkne≈øs.

               <p n="4">4.

Though the per≈øon may have grace truly wrought in him, to make him ≈øee all this vilene≈øs, yet it may be long ere his faith ≈øhall be able comfortably to apprehend Gods mercy to forgive it.

Concerning a <hi>Serious Con≈øideration of a Sinful Condition:</hi> It is an <hi>Intentive work of the Judgment, wherein it doth narrowly and diligently meditate on the whole e≈øtate of ≈øin.</hi> It is called in Scripture, a remembring of our wayes; and ≈øometimes a bethinking of our ≈øelves, and a ≈øeeing what we have done, a pondring of our paths. It is oppo≈øed not only to Ignorance and Ne≈øcience, but al≈øo to Negligence; yea, to ra≈øhne≈øs and ≈øuddenne≈øs; and indeed it is a very deep ≈øearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and minding, and weighing of matters: When a man ≈øits down and mu≈øeth, ≈øo that his mind and thoughts are throughly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, he makes it a ≈øpecial bu≈øine≈øs, he bends all his ≈øtrength rightly to inform him≈øelf, to bring him≈øelf to a right under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his e≈øtate; this is a proper con≈øideration.

The ≈øerious con≈øideration of a mans ≈øinfulne≈øs, falls into this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it is not a confu≈øed work, or a light overly ≈øight of ≈øin, it is a ≈øetled and deep pondering of the e≈øtate in the Qualities, Acts and Fruits of it; Nature, Number, Circum≈øtances, Danger: <hi>v. g.</hi> 
                  <q>When I ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider of my ≈øinful e≈øtate, I reflect on my ≈øelf, what kind of life I lead, what are tho≈øe qualities, what tho≈øe wayes which I find and walk in: my Thoughts, my Affections, my Speeches have been thus; and thus my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thus my cour≈øe of Life.

By them all I have violated a righteous Will, di≈øhonored and provoked a great God (who≈øe wrath is a con≈øuming fire) I have (to ≈øatisfie them) lo≈øt all my comforts, cau≈øed many evils to others, brought many mi≈øeries on my ≈øelf, put Chri≈øt to death, and, if God be not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, lo≈øt my mi≈øerable ≈øoul for ever. The≈øe wayes (will I
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115664:40"/> not believe mine own eyes?) are extremely ≈øinful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (≈øhould I not believe the Scriptures) are damnable: many a year have I run this cour≈øe, and often times under checks of Con≈øcience; very much evil hath already been upon me, and all for ≈øin; ≈øome troubles of Con≈øcience: And that wrath which God threatens and is behind, is terrible. If I go on thus, I peri≈øh for ever; for whil≈øt I keep my ≈øins, the lea≈øt ≈øin of them, I mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily part with God, and lo≈øe my ≈øoul. Tell me, O my vainly deluded ≈øoul, can that be good which God hates, or ≈øafe, which God doth cur≈øe? Would≈øt thou dye thus? O then thou dye≈øt for ever; and why then wilt thou live thus any longer? O thou ha≈øt pre≈øumed too far already; perhaps Patience will bear no longer, and Mercy being often abu≈øed, may be for ever recalled; and then, thou, O my Soul, then whither wilt thou go? No, no, we mu≈øt no more of the≈øe forbidden fruits, and no longer mu≈øt we trade in the paths of death; there is a God who hath lookt on thee all this while, and hates thy wayes, and hath ≈øealed his implacable wrath with an Oath if thou return not: Come, my ≈øoul, think aright of God, of thy pa≈øt acts, of thy pre≈øent e≈øtate, of thy future condition; believe me, thy Guilts are many, thy Accounts will be bitter; God hath been ≈øtill di≈øhonoured, he will not be mocked; let us return, for we are out of the way of Heaven, and are even upon the brink of Hell.</q>

He who indeed judgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf not worthy of the lea≈øt of all the mercies and truth which God ≈øhews unto him, will take up a great mi≈øery with quietne≈øs, and a little mercy with thankfulne≈øs. The body of man if it bee ≈øound, can ≈øtoop for a pin, as well as for a piece; and the heart, if it be humble, can ble≈øs for little mercies, as well as for great. The touch of the little finger, as well as of the great, will make a well-tuned ≈øtringed in≈øtrument ≈øpeak, and even the whi≈øperings of the voice are ecchoed back in an exact concave. The lea≈øt drops of mercy affect the lowly heart, which can awake upon the lea≈øt noi≈øe. The proud heart like the mountain yields a poor crop after a ≈øhower of mercies, but the humble heart, like the Gardens, yields plenty of ≈øweet ≈ømelling ≈øacrifices, after the lea≈øt dews or drops of merciful ble≈ø≈øings and an≈øwers from God. Now ≈øay, How do you plead with God when you approach unto him? what can you ≈øhew for the mercies that you ask? onely his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, no worth in you to move him: And how are you when God delaies, or denies, or removes his mercies? can you then be in du≈øt and a≈øhes, and not in fire and flames? can you yet quietly ≈øerve him, wait on him, depend on him, ≈øubmit to him upon this ground? Ah! I am a ≈øinner; I have wronged the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; abu≈øed all his mercies; am not worthy of the lea≈øt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: It is mercy that ever I had mercy, that now I have any, that which is lo≈øt and denied, I am not worthy of them; that which I have, I am not worthy of. And when God an≈øwers you either in ≈øpirituals, to your ≈øouls; or in temporals, to your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, How do you look upon his an≈øwers? Do you look a ≈øquint on them as he upon <hi>Solomons</hi> Cities? Are you able to abu≈øe great mercies, and ≈ølight the lea≈øt? 5.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becau≈øe many pervert this Doctrine of per≈øonal unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine≈øs:</hi> they utterly mi≈øtake it; they do profe≈øs that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Many pervert the Doctrine of per≈øonal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthine≈øs.</note> that is in them can de≈øerve any thing with God, and therefore trample upon all holine≈øs of heart, and godline≈øs of life, as if there were no u≈øe of Grace but to merit; or Gold were of no u≈øe but in a Crown. But the≈øe are a loath≈øome people, who would link great mercies and a wicked life together: To be ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our unworthine≈øs is not to re≈øt in an evil condition, nor is it to run on in an evil conver≈øation, nor is it to ≈ølight holy duties for thy performances, nor is it to di≈øregard habitual or actual Grace: this argues an un≈øen≈øible and ≈øeared con≈øcience: But this it is, to ≈øtrive again≈øt ≈øin, to ≈øtrive after all holine≈øs, to be careful and watchful to pious performances, yet with all, and after all, to ca≈øt tho≈øe Crowns to the ground, not in their names, but in the name of Chri≈øt, and free mercy to expect an≈øwer and help.

               <p n="1">1. That the execution of a penitential re≈øolution, is nothing <note place="margin">This is meant of the very pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> el≈øe but <hi>an acting cour≈øe, or the very practi≈øe of Repentance.</hi> When not onely the Judgement approves of the parts and rules of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the Will embraceth them with con≈øent and de≈øire, but the Endeavour al≈øo doth, as it were, copy them forth in the Conver≈øation. <hi>I exerci≈øe my ≈øelf to have a good con≈øcience,</hi> ≈øaid the Apo≈øtle: So when the ≈øinner doth exerci≈øe Repentance, when he doth hate ≈øin indeed, and flies from it, and for≈øakes it indeed; and when he doth indeed walk in the ways of new obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115664:75"/> a very ≈øervant of righteou≈øne≈øs, and works the work of God, this is the execution, or the performance of a penitential pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe and re≈øolution. As walking is to a journey, or as writing is to a copy, or as fighting is to a war, that is penitential execution to penitential re≈øolution. It is but the Theory (as it were) drawn down and put forth; It is as the tree ≈øhooting out into blo≈ø≈øoms and fruits: It is repentance in life, which is the life of repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That pre≈øentne≈øs of Execution is <hi>an undelayed acting.</hi> Our actions fall vvithin three ≈øpaces of time; either of the vvhich is <note place="margin">And of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delayed acting.</note> pa≈øt (as vvhat vve have done;) or of that vvhich is future (as that vvhich ≈øhall be done;) or of that vvhich is pre≈øent (as that vvhich is doing.) Look as true Marriage, it is not a future, but a pre≈øent acceptation: So true Repentance is not a delayed, but a pre≈øent reformation. Or as in Writing, the motion of the Pen and the forming of the Letter are ≈øimultaneous: Or as in a Clock, the vvheel doth move and the finger doth move: So in the bu≈øine≈øs of Repentance; the purpo≈øe of amendment, ≈øhould at the ≈øame time drop out into the change of heart and vvays. To have repentance onely in our purpo≈øes, is onely to have water in a cloud, or phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick in a gla≈øs, it is not yet to do it. Re≈øolutions may be for the future, but Executions are for the pre≈øent act; an hearing while it is to day, and not hardning of the heart. As St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being called, vvent immediately up to <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> ≈øo pre≈øent executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repentance is, vvhen we do not defer the penitential work; a not allowing of our ≈øelves in giving vvay to our ≈øins, no, not an hour, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpake in another ca≈øe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is a two-fold pre≈øent execution of penitential purpo≈øes: One is <hi>immediate;</hi> or vvhen the purpo≈øe and the acting <note place="margin">And of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent execution, either for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatene≈øs, or ≈øea≈øonablene≈øs.</note> (vvithout di≈øtance of time) ≈øucceed one the other, there being no predominant impediment to the in≈øtantaneous execution of that penitential purpo≈øe. Another is <hi>≈øea≈øonable;</hi> vvhere, though twixt the purpo≈øe and the acting there may be ≈øome di≈øtance of time, yet the apprehen≈øion of the next occa≈øion may truly make the execution or practi≈øe to be pre≈øent. As in the ca≈øe of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential re≈øtitution, it may ≈øo fall out, either through the inability of the e≈øtate, or the ≈øubjection of the per≈øon, that he cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately re≈øtore; yet becau≈øe the penitent per≈øon in ≈øuch a ca≈øe layes hold on the next opportunity and occa≈øion, his re≈øolution may be ≈øaid to be acted pre≈øently, <hi>(i.)</hi> upon the next pre≈øent

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>2. <hi>It is very dangerous to defer our penitential Executions</hi> or actings: Whether we con≈øider, 1. <hi>The Re≈øolutions them≈øelves;</hi>

We read of the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> that they were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtedfa≈øt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115664:76"/> people in Covenant, and like <hi>a deceitfull Bow.</hi> Naked Re≈øolutions will never ripen and abide; if you will not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your Re≈øolutions, you will quickly fall from your Re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 2. <hi>Our own hearts, ah! how deceitfull are they!</hi> how full of rebellion! how aver≈øe to all good! Like the cold hearth to a little fire; how cunning to keep up Sin in the Throne! how willing to break a≈øunder all the bands of Obedience! with much adoe re≈øolving, with little adoe di≈ø≈øolving tho≈øe re≈øolves again. <hi>Volebam</hi> (≈øaith St. <hi>Au≈øtin) &amp; nolebam;</hi> I would, and yet I would not; one while I would, and by and by I wouldnot. It is the Genius of cur ≈øinfull hearts, to apprehend the pre≈øent time for ≈øin, and to crave the future time for repentance: Our wor≈øt work we would do in≈øtantly, our be≈øt work we would do negligently: Good motions are like a Bird falling into our hands, which if we pre≈øently catch not, ≈øhe in≈øtantly flees away. Gracious purpo≈øes in our hearts, are like warmth in the water; the impre≈ø≈øion requires ≈øome degrees, and ≈øome blowing; but the rece≈ø≈øion is ea≈øie; the natural coldne≈øs in the water will in≈øtantly ri≈øe up and expel that heat: if you be not watchfull, <hi>&amp;c. 3. Extingui≈øhing occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Repentance, in all the parts of it, hath many enemies and hinderances, ≈øome within us, ≈øome without us: the Re≈øolutions are weak, but the Occa≈øions are ≈øtrong. Let the ≈øhip alone, and if the Pilot hath onely a re≈øolution to ≈øail with, the next tide, or the next wind may carry the ≈øhip away. How ordinary is the experience, That the ≈øtrength of occa≈øions have beaten back, and put to flight many and many a re≈øolution? like a cro≈øs wind, which hath carried back the ≈øhip unto the very harbour whence it came forth. Meer re≈øolutions are but unarmed Souldiers, or as unwalled Cities. You ≈øhall find much of this truth, That meet re≈øolutions are too weak for proper and ≈øudden occa≈øions. 4. <hi>Or the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Grace</hi> To re≈øolve, and not to act, is one way whereby we quench the Spirit. The Spirit, you know, may be quenched many ways: <hi>Po≈øitively,</hi> as when we will walk in paths expre≈øly contrary to his motions; this is to throw water upon the fire: <hi>Negatively,</hi> when we do not follow nor cheri≈øh his motions; as you quench the fire, if you do not ≈øtir it, or blow it, or add more unto it. So when the Spirit of God ≈øhall deal thus far with us, as to convince us that our cour≈øe is evil, and yet further, to excite a purpo≈øe in our hearts to de≈øi≈øt; but then we let the work
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115664:77"/> lie ≈øtill, we do not ≈øt again≈øt that evil way, this may cau≈øe the Spirit of God to withdraw, to de≈øert the ≈øinner who doth de≈øert his coun≈øel; who will be a Coun≈øell our to him, who will walk in no coun≈øel but his own.</p>

When we come to the acting part, then the Lord will exert and put forth his power in our weakne≈øs: the acting and doing Chri≈øtian partakes of mo≈øt a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance. Do we not find it thus in Prayer, and in many other Duties, which perhaps we look upon with much fear and ≈øu≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But when we are acting of them, how ≈øingularly doth the Lord enlarge our thoughts and affections? Why! this holds in the very Duty of Repentance; ≈øeta again≈øt thy ≈øins in good earne≈øt, ≈øet upon a holy cour≈øe in good earne≈øt, thou ≈øhalt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permentally find, that it was thy owne deceitfull heart which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented the work with more difficulty; but now having taken upon thee the yoke of Chri≈øt, thou ≈øhalt find it ea≈øie, and that God can as well work in thee to do, as to will. 2.

We cannot ≈øay our re≈øolutions are ≈øolid, if unactive. If they do not alter the cour≈øe, for ought as we know yet, they may be but fal≈øe fla≈øhes, occa≈øional impre≈ø≈øions, not ≈øpringing from renewing Grace, (which will break out into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe,) but from ≈øervile cau≈øes, which may be ≈øufficient to ≈øtop a ≈øinner, and with <hi>Saul,</hi> to profe≈øs he will per≈øecute <hi>David</hi> no more: But when Execution attends Re≈øolution, now the heart may be confident, that there is a renewing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple implanted, which carries the ≈øoul from one degree to another; from convictions to re≈øolutions, from re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to actions, from actions to cour≈øes with ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs.</p>

In the <hi>Impre≈ø≈øion of it:</hi> ANd this is when ≈øo much grace
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115664:84"/> is implanted, as to turn the heart. 2. <hi>In the expre≈ø≈øion of it:</hi> and this is, when ≈øo much Grace appears, as to enter into a new path, and do new works. 3. <hi>In the progre≈ø≈øion of it:</hi> And this is, when a greater Victory is obtained over our ≈øins, and appears in our cour≈øe of new obedience. Now the Initials of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I conjecture, to con≈øi≈øts partly in the Conver≈øion of the heart; when the mind, and will, and affections are healed, and turned: and partly, in the reformation of the life; when the per≈øon out of an hatred of ≈øin, and love of God, ≈øets upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cour≈øe of obedience, and ≈øervice. It is ju≈øt like a Ship, that is going out, or like a Shop that is newly ≈øet up; things are very raw, there is much dro≈øs with the little Silver; a little health, and much lamene≈øs; a great journey, and but a few ≈øteps; the work is rather in de≈øire, and much in complaints; and though perhaps little be done, yet all is heartily endeavoured to be done; this I call the Initials of Repentance.</p>
               <p>There are ≈øix things ≈øhew that Repentance is begun in truth. <note place="margin">Six things ≈øhew Repentance is begun in truth. Condemnation.</note> 1. One is <hi>Condemnation:</hi> When the judgement looks upon all ≈øin after another manner then formerly, ≈øentencing it as the mo≈øt vile, and accur≈øed of all evils, and no ≈øin (knowingly) finds favour. 2. Another is <hi>Aver≈øation:</hi> When the will flies, <note place="margin">Aver≈øation.</note> and ≈øhuns it, as that, which is mo≈øt contrary to all goodne≈øs, and happine≈øs. 3. A third is <hi>Wearine≈øs:</hi> When the Soul is as <note place="margin">Wearine≈øs.</note> weary of Sin, as any Porter can be of his Burthen, or as a ≈øick-man is of his Bed. P≈øal. 51. 17. <hi>The ≈øacrifices of God, are a broken ≈øpirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not de≈øpi≈øe.</hi> 4. A fourth is <hi>Lamentation:</hi> That the Soul cannot yet be rid of <note place="margin">Lamentation.</note> the unruly motions, and in≈øolencies of ≈øin; It is grieved, that Life and Death, Hell and Heaven, Grace and Sin ≈øhould thus be together. 5. A fifth is <hi>Re≈øi≈øtance,</hi> or conflict: The Soul doth <note place="margin">Re≈øi≈øtance.</note> u≈øe the be≈øt means it can, to ≈øeparate more from ≈øin, and all ≈øinfull wayes, and to walk only in all holy pathes, in the pathes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs. And the ≈øixth is <hi>an active Inctination,</hi> to obey God in all things; a thir≈øting and ≈øtriving, an aiming, a writing after the Copy. <note place="margin">An active In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And there are four things, which do ≈øhew that Repentance is <note place="margin">Four things ≈øhew that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is but begun. Impotency.</note> but begun, it is only initial. 1. One is <hi>Impotency,</hi> or weakne≈øs of operation: When the penitential parts do move and ≈øtir, yet like a child, who begins to go very feebly. There is as much
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115664:84"/> appears in the cour≈øe, as declares another ≈øpring or principle, and rule, by which the Soul ≈øtrives to walk, but the performance is very tender and feeble; like a young Tree that hath but tender branches, and ≈ømall fruit: The per≈øon doth mourn, and confe≈øs, and pray, and live, and obey, but with weakne≈øs. 2. A ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>efficacy of Temptation:</hi> When Temptations do ea≈øily <note place="margin">Efficacy of Temptation.</note> be≈øet and di≈øcourage the Soul; as when the Tree is but a young plant, the Winds to to≈øs it, and make it reel; ≈øo when Temptations do, as it were, drive the Soul, and are apt to rai≈øe quick fears, and di≈øcouragements: Oh! I ≈øhall be overcome again, I ≈øhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold on, I cannot well ≈øee how I ≈øhall be able to perform, and pre≈øerve in the≈øe wayes which I have cho≈øen. A third is the <hi>Validity of pre≈øent Corruption;</hi> which though it be truly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and bewailed, yet it is very apt upon occa≈øions to a≈ø≈øault and <note place="margin">Validity of pre≈øent Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> prevail; when every little ≈øtone is apt to make one ≈øtumble, it argues that the ≈øtrength is weak. 4. <hi>Nece≈ø≈øary pre≈øence of many helps:</hi> When a Man cannot go, but with two Crutches; and a Child mu≈øt lean upon many props, and a penitent upon many ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible encouragements.</p>
               <p>Now that the≈øe Initials of Repentance are graciou≈øly accepted <note place="margin">The Doctrine proved. God re≈øpects the truth as well as the degrees of Grace.</note> of God, may be thus manife≈øted. 1. <hi>The Lord doth re≈øpect the truth of Grace, as well as the degrees of it,</hi> every quality as well as the quantity. <hi>Are not thine eyes upon the truth?</hi> The Gold≈ømith hath his eye on the very thin raies of Godl, as well as on the great knobs and pieces; Grace is excellent and amiable at the lowe≈øt, though then admirable when at highe≈øt. 2. <hi>The main thing that God looks upon, is to the heart; (My Son, give me thy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God looks mo≈øt at the Heart.</note> 
                  <hi>heart:)</hi> All that is done, if the heart be not in it, it is of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no e≈øtimation with God; but if the heart be right, this the Lord prizeth exceedingly, and ≈øo much, that for its ≈øake, he pa≈ø≈øeth by many infirmities. <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart.</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. 19. Now in the Initials of Repentance, the heart is ≈øet right; it is ≈øet on God, and towards God in truth. 3. <hi>Even the Initials of Repentance are his own Gifts</hi> (≈øpecial gifts of his ble≈ø≈øed Spirit) it is he that <hi>worketh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Initials of Repentance are his Ci≈øt.</note> 
                  <hi>in us to will and to do, Phil.</hi> 2. 13. The ≈øpirituall will, and the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deed (though both be imperfect) yet are they the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine effect of Gods own ≈øpirit; ≈øparks out of his fire, works of his own hands: Now as in the Creation, God looked upon all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115664:85"/> that he made, and ≈øaw that it was good, he liked it well. So is it in our Renovation; all that good which God works in us, he doth accept and approve, he doth not de≈øpi≈øe his own image, which though it ≈øhine more fairly in progre≈ø≈øive Repentance, yet is it truly ≈øtampt in our initial Conver≈øion. 4.

In this re≈øpect the former ≈øins of a penitent fall within Gods notice; for the goodne≈øs of Divine Mercy doth not blind-fold the eye of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Omni≈øcience. 2. <hi>Notitia Charitativa;</hi> which is a notice of ≈øins, as a kind Creditor takes notice of Debts owing unto him, and ≈øet down in his book, his eye is on them, and his Pen al≈øo to cro≈øs and da≈øh them out. And in this re≈øpect al≈øo God takes notice of former ≈øins, namely, ≈øo as out of rich love,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115664:105"/> and gracious favour to cro≈øs and forgive them: unle≈øs we will fondly imagine that God forgives ≈øins by hap-chance, at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, never ≈øeeing and con≈øidering what he doth. 3. <hi>Notitia Vindictiva;</hi> which is a Judiciary notice, as a Judge takes notice <note place="margin">Notitia Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictiva.</note> of the evil facts of a Malefactor to Condemn him, or to trouble and vex him. In this re≈øpect, upon true Repentance, God takes no notice of former ≈øins, <hi>(.i.)</hi> either <hi>to condemn the penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon for them,</hi> or, <hi>to upbraid him</hi> and di≈øhearten him by ca≈øting them into his di≈øh, or hitting of him in the teeth, as we ≈øpeak Proverbially. Hence tho≈øe phra≈øes in the Scripture upon ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of Repentance, Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and I will remember their ≈øin no more.</hi> Not that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance makes God forgetful (for he is no: capable of ≈øuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as Oblivion) but that when men cea≈øe to ≈øin, God will cea≈øe to argue and ≈øpeak with them after a Judicial manner for their ≈øins. So Ezek. 18. 21. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ≈øins that he hath committed;</hi> ver. 22. <hi>All his tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions which he hath committed, they ≈øhall not be mentioned unto him;</hi> he means, in any har≈øh, judicial, and cutting way.

Another is <hi>revenge:</hi> you know the Apo≈øtle makes this one of the fruits of godly ≈øorrow and repentance; <hi>yea what revenge?</hi> 2. Cor. 7. Now this revenge, as it con≈øi≈øts in many other things, ≈øo in this e≈øpecially; that as we have imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ≈øoules and bodies in wicked acts to ≈øerve again≈øt the Lord to his di≈øhonor, ≈øo now we imploy and improve them in holy ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the proper glory of God; now we bu≈øy them, to know him, to love him, to obey him, to honour him: The penitent per≈øon is ≈øo ≈øen≈øible of the infinite di≈øhonour which God hath had by his ≈øinful life, that if he had now a thou≈øand ≈øouls and bodies, and ten thou≈øand lives, all were little enough in all holine≈øs of Conver≈øation to redeem tho≈øe di≈øhonours, and repair them.</p>

Remember two things: 1. <hi>That the Lord will bring back to him≈øelf no ≈øoul, but by Je≈øus Chri≈øt: Chri≈øt</hi> is the ≈øinners <hi>way</hi> to the Father; he is the <hi>door</hi> by which you are admitted: If ever the Lord ca≈øts an eye on thee, or take thee by the hand, it is for his Chri≈øt's ≈øake. 2. <hi>A lo≈øt ≈øoul,</hi> which is found, <hi>finds an ab≈øolute need of Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> Nothing out of Chri≈øt can make peace, can ju≈øtifie, can reconcile, can ≈øet us ≈øtraight, can make us accepted. Had I all other things, and had not Chri≈øt, I were ≈øtill a lo≈øt per≈øon: Had I the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs of Angels, yet if I had not Chri≈øt, I were lo≈øt; could I mourn, could I repent, could I pray, could I live holily, could I walk exactly, yet I am lo≈øt; I am ≈øtill lo≈øt, until I get into Chri≈øt. <hi>I count all things but lo≈øs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Je≈øus Chri≈øt my Lord.</hi> God will look on me as my Judge, he will look on me as his enemy, he will not own me as a Father, as a reconciled Father, but in Chri≈øt.</p>

               <p>The≈øe words do hold forth a pithy de≈øcription of a ≈øinners conver≈øion; that is, a pa≈ø≈øage from death to life; or a mutation from a dead condition, into a living condition; the e≈øtate of ≈øin is a dead e≈øtate, yea, a deadly e≈øtate; and the ≈øtate of Grace, is a living e≈øtate, yea, a lively e≈øtate. There any many Doctrinal Propo≈øitions, which are couched in the≈øe words: As 1. That an impenitent, or unconverted man, is a dead man: <hi>[This my Son was dead]</hi> 2. That when a ≈øinner is converted, he is then made a live: <hi>[And is alive]</hi> 3. That God doth ≈øometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a very great and notorious ≈øinner: <hi>[This, this my Son]</hi> 4. That great afflictions are ≈øometimes the means of a great ≈øinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion: <hi>[This my Son was]</hi> 5. That there is an almighty power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to convert or change a ≈øinner [As much as to make a dead man to live.] 6. That true Conver≈øion is a very great and con≈øpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alteration: (No change is like that from death to life.) 7. That true Conver≈øion is an inward, or a ≈øoul-alteration; not of cloaths, or painting: (It is the putting of life into a dead man.) 8. That a ≈øinner contributes nothing at all towards his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, but Conver≈øion of a ≈øinner, is the ≈øole work of a God; (for it is God only, who can quicken the dead, no dead man can make him≈øelf alive.) 9. That the Lord takes notice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition of man (of the <hi>Prodigals</hi> former condition, <hi>he was dead,</hi> and of his pre≈øent condition, but <hi>he is alive again.)</hi> 10. That the Lord doth own every converted per≈øon, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owns a Son: <hi>[This my Son.]</hi>

               <p>I now proceed to another Propo≈øition, which is implyed in the≈øe words:</p>

               <p>There is a twofold opinion about the power which is put forth <note place="margin">The power put forth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion.

There ≈øhall be to rai≈øe the dead at the la≈øt; when a ≈øinner is converted, he is ≈øaid to be created again, to be born again, to be regenerated; his heart is ≈øaid to be opened, and circumci≈øed; his ≈øtrong heart is taken away, an heart of fle≈øh is given unto him; ≈øurely all this is more then a moral power. 2. <hi>This moral ≈øua≈øion mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily pre≈øuppo≈øe ≈øome power and abilities in him with whom it deals;</hi> as if you coun≈øel a man, you ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øomething in him to incline him to hearken; if you do not ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe ≈øuch a power, then it mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed that your coun≈øel is in vain; as if you ≈øhould coun≈øel an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> to change his skin, or a blind man to ≈øee; this were in vain, for there is no power in them to do the≈øe. 3. <hi>The conver≈øion of a ≈øinner in re≈øpect of God ≈øhould be then contingent;</hi> It might be, and it might not be; Though God intends to convert a man, yet he may fail and mi≈øs of the event, for as much as a moral work is re≈øi≈øtable, and may ea≈øily be put by. <hi>How often would I have gathered your children, and you would not; yee alwayes re≈øi≈øt the Holy-Gho≈øt. 4. Yea, the Conver≈øion of a ≈øinner ≈øhould in the event depend more upon the will of man, then on the will of God.</hi> The grace offered is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and it is made peculiar, and differential by mans will; the right u≈øe of grace is not of grace, but of free will; ≈øo that <hi>di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimen ≈øiliorum Dei &amp; ≈øeculi,</hi> is <hi>a natura,</hi> not <hi>ex gratia.</hi> The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ≈øua≈øion is pre≈øented unto two ≈øinners, the ≈øua≈øion is alike; why doth it bring this man and not the other man to Conver≈øion?

               <p>Another is accidental, which alters the qualities of man. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was the ≈øame man when he was a Leper, and when he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his Lepro≈øie; he was the ≈øame for ≈øub≈øtance, (of it there was no change,) but he was not the ≈øame for the accidental quality, (becau≈øe his lepro≈øie was changed.) Such a change is there in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion; the ≈øinfull Lepro≈øie is changed, and a fair beautiful form of holine≈øs is put into his ≈øoul; the Glove is now perfumed, the bitter water is now ≈øea≈øoned, another nature contrary to his former nature is now infu≈øed; <hi>old things are pa≈øt away, all things are become new,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 17. Againe ob≈øerve, that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental change, or alteration of a per≈øon, is likewi≈øe two-fold; 1. One is <hi>Corruptive,</hi> which is from good to evil; ≈øuch a change was there in the <hi>Angels that fell,</hi> (they fell from heaven to hell, from being Children of Light, to be the Princes of darkne≈øs)
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115664:157"/> and ≈øuch a change was there in <hi>Adam</hi> that fell. O what a change! what a ≈øudden lo≈øs of great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, of un≈øpeakable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. O how good once he was, O what a ≈øinner now he is! 2. Another is <hi>perfective,</hi> which is from evil to Good: Such a change is Conver≈øion: Why! it is from ≈øin to God: It is more then for <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> to leave the pri≈øon and be made a Prince: when a man is converted, he is now rai≈øed and enabled with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and life, and excellencies of God and Chri≈øt; true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion is a perfecting change.</p>
               <p>One di≈øtinction more I cannot omit; It is this, The perfective change is likewi≈øe two-fold 1. <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>forin≈øecal,</hi> as in the Ju≈øtification of a ≈øinner: when a ≈øinner is Ju≈øtified, the ≈øtate of this ≈øinner is changed; before it he was in the ≈øtate of death and condemnation; after it he is in the ≈øtate of life and ab≈øolution. 2. <hi>Inherent</hi> and <hi>intrin≈øecal;</hi> as here in the conver≈øion of a ≈øinner, which is a change within a man; a change not ≈øo properly of his <hi>condition,</hi> as of his <hi>di≈øpo≈øition;</hi> even from one contrary to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that <hi>√† Genere ad Genus,</hi> from one kind of quality to another kind. A ≈øinner hath ≈øometimes a contrary motion of good to evil put into him, but this is not Conver≈øion; for it is not a mutation, but a motion: A ≈øinners inclination is ≈øometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, that he doth not ≈øin; yet this is not conver≈øion, for it is a chaining only, not a changing of his di≈øpo≈øition; the Lyon is a Lyon in chains. A ≈øinner goes from one ≈øin to another; he leaveth his riotou≈øne≈øs, and turneth to coveteou≈øne≈øs; he leaveth profanene≈øs, and turneth to hypocri≈øy; yet this is not Conver≈øion, for his ≈øinful di≈øpo≈øition is not altered from kind to kind: It is but a ≈øhifting from one evil to another evil; as the wind from one poynt to another; it is not a change from evil to good. If a man could leave all the ≈øins in the world, and yet he loved and ≈øerved but one, this man is not a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, becau≈øe conver≈øion is a change from one kind to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary kind, which the man comes ≈øhort of who≈øe heart is ≈øtill ≈øet on any one ≈øin.</p>
               <p>2. True Conver≈øion is <hi>a very great and notable Change;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is a very great and not able change.</note> there is no change, I think, in all the world of that height and depth as the conver≈øion of a ≈øinner.

                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:115664:157"/> The Scripture doth frequently parallel it even with tho≈øe changes which are miraculous: When Chri≈øt made the <hi>blind to ≈øee,</hi> and the <hi>deaf to hear,</hi> and the <hi>dumb to ≈øpeak,</hi> and the <hi>dead to live,</hi> and <hi>di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Devils;</hi> the≈øe were very great and notable changes, take them ≈øingle and they were ≈øo. Now all the≈øe miracles are wrought in any one converted per≈øon; 'Tis called a <hi>Creation,</hi> a <hi>Re≈øurrection,</hi> &amp;c. becau≈øe God puts out as much Power in the Conver≈øion of a ≈øinner, as he did in creating the World. It is the prime work of the Spirit of Chri≈øt, the top, the very highe≈øt; when any one man is converted, the blind is made to ≈øee, and the deaf is made to hear: (I≈øai. 29. 18. <hi>In that day ≈øhall the deaf hear the words of the Book, and the eyes of the blind ≈øhall ≈øee out of ob≈øcurity, and out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,)</hi> and the dumb is made to ≈øpeak, and the lame is made to leap: I≈øai. 35. 5. <hi>The eyes of the blind ≈øhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ≈øhall be un≈øtopped.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Then ≈øhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ≈øing:</hi> Yea, and the dead is made to live; <hi>[This my Son was dead, and is alive again;]</hi> and ≈øo many ≈øins as there are from which the heart is converted, of ≈øo many Devils is that heart di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed; thy filthine≈øs was an unclean Devil, and thy per≈øecution was a raging Devil; every ≈øin that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed thee was a ≈øtrong Devil within thee: Oh, what a great change is it to behold a ≈øtone turned into fle≈øh! and yet in Conver≈øion, <hi>The heart of ≈øtone is turned into an heart of fle≈øh,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26.

                  <hi>very little Grace to produce all this:</hi> That one drop ≈øhould ≈øwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the great bitter Ocean; that one little ≈øpark ≈øhould cau≈øe all this flame; A very little Engine ≈øhould move all the World, and level the Mountains; a little Grace to enter the Throne, and to turn all the ≈øoul round about.

True Conver≈øion <hi>is an inward change:</hi> When <note place="margin">It is an inward change.</note> a dead man is made alive, this is done by the infu≈øion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of life; the cloathing of a dead man is one thing, and the quickning of a dead man is another thing; it is one

Every converted man hath a changed heart; we ≈øay in nature, that <hi>Cor e≈øt primum vivens:</hi> It is true al≈øo in Grace, the fir≈øt work of quickning and converting Grace begins in the heart of a ≈øinner. The heart fir≈øt fell from God, and it is the fir≈øt that turns unto God. The heart is the fir≈øt Seat of Sin, and it is the fir≈øt Throne of Grace: Sin is the wound and di≈øea≈øe of the heart, and Grace mu≈øt bring the Plai≈øter thither; ≈øin is fir≈øt in the heart, and mo≈øt in the heart; dominion is there, the poy≈øon is there; bring in the heart, prevail with it, and you bring in all the man: An outward change without an inward change, is 1.

A change <hi>from ≈øecurity to trouble</hi> and perplexity: It is po≈ø≈øible that a great <note place="margin">From ≈øecurity to trouble.</note> ≈øinner who was as ≈øen≈øele≈øs as the Rock, may now be as trembling as the Leaf, and his con≈øcience troubled as the Sea, and yet his heart not converted; <hi>Cain</hi> was troubled, ≈øo was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ≈øo was <hi>Saul,</hi> ≈øo was <hi>Judas,</hi> yet none of them converted: There is a trouble which ri≈øeth from a quick con≈øcience, and there is a trouble which ri≈øeth from quickning grace; this latter is an evidence of true Conver≈øion, the other is not. 4. <hi>A temporary change,</hi> or <note place="margin">A temporary change.</note> rather a tran≈øient diver≈øity in the affections. It is po≈ø≈øible for ≈øome ≈øcornful per≈øon to hear the Go≈øpel preached by ≈øome <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> (as <hi>Herod</hi> did) with joy, and to hear ≈øome <hi>Paul</hi> (as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> did) with trembling, who formerly ≈øcorned all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yea, this man may be in a great changeablene≈øs, yet never be truly changed; divine truths may fall upon him with that evidence and efficacy, as to ≈øhake his heart, ≈øtir his affections, excite his re≈øolutions, and yet after a little while, as the cold doth on Water that is heated, all the≈øe workings expire into nothing, his old incorporated, familiar lu≈øts prevail over them, and work them wholly out; till the inward change be a change of the heart, it is not a truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting change.</p>
               <p>4. La≈øtly, true Conver≈øion is <hi>an univer≈øal change:</hi> When <note place="margin">It is a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal change.</note> a dead man is quickned, the ≈øoul is not only infu≈øed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo diffu≈øed, it is <hi>tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> the whole made alive; ≈øo is it in true Conver≈øion, that grace which converts a ≈øinner, doth change all the ≈øinner, every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ≈øoul for the quality of it, and every member of the body, for the ≈øpiritual u≈øe of it: Therefore, converting

You cannot dip into any leaf of this Book, into any parcel of a converted man, but you ≈øhall find a divine and ≈øpiritual change, a ≈øpirit of grace on it.

And now the man inquires, and hears, and confers, and prayes, as for his life: Oh (≈øaith he) I need mercy, and mercy I mu≈øt have; I need Chri≈øt, and Chri≈øt I mu≈øt have; I need grace, and grace I mu≈øt have; and as that impotent per≈øon lay at the Pool for cure, ≈øo doth this converted ≈øinner; he lyes at the pool of the word, and at the gates of heaven day and night; and there he cries out, God be merciful to me a ≈øinner; and there he <hi>wre≈øtles with God,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> once; <hi>I will not let thee go unle≈øs thou ble≈øs me;</hi> until thou be reconciled, until I have Chri≈øt, until my heart be ≈øanctifyed. 4. <hi>His hardned remor≈øele≈øne≈øs is now turned into a ≈øingular brokenne≈øs</hi> and grief of ≈øpirit; the Rock is ≈ømitten, and the waters gu≈øh out; a Fountain is opened within him: He who made but a ≈øport of ≈øinning before; he who could gra≈øp the nettles, and tread on hell, and vex mercy, and ≈øhoot through the heart of Chri≈øt, and not be moved or troubled at all: Oh now, how is the man altered?

Another while he hears, and reads, and weeps, I am that man, O Lord; I am he of whom thou ≈øpeake≈øt, I am that ≈øinner; Iam he who hath out-faced thy Law, out-≈øtood thy offers of grace, and re≈øi≈øted (Oh how often) thy good Spirit. 5. <hi>He is now for the life of God to be wrought in him:</hi> This he now prizeth as the mo≈øt excellent life; and for this, he praies, Lord, another heart, a new ≈øpirit.</p>

The ≈øecond contrariety re≈øpects <hi>the time pre≈øent:</hi> And <note place="margin">As to the time pre≈øent.</note> there are four things for the time pre≈øent, in a truely changed and converted per≈øon which never were in him before. 1. A pre≈øent hatred of ≈øin. 2. A pre≈øent flying unto Chri≈øt. 3. A pre≈øent love of God. 4. A pre≈øent cour≈øe of new obedience. 1. When the Lord hath converted and changed the heart of a ≈øinner, there is wrought in him <hi>a pre≈øent hatred of ≈øin;</hi> the man loved his ≈øins before, and took plea≈øure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, held it fa≈øt, and defended it; ≈øin is now ≈øeen as the greate≈øt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115664:165"/> evil, and the more he ≈øees it, the more he hates it: As ≈øoon as ever the heart is changed, immediately it is a ≈øin-hating heart; I do not ≈øay there is no ≈øin, but I ≈øay the heart hates ≈øin: <hi>The evil that I hate,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 15. and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. where God promi≈øeth to give them <hi>a new heart,</hi> he ≈øaith, <hi>Then ≈øhall ye remember your own evil wayes, and ≈øhall loath your ≈øelves in your own ≈øight for your iniquities, and for your abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

                  <hi>Que≈øt.</hi> But here now is a great Scruple, how a per≈øon may know that he hates ≈øin? Many think they do ≈øo, and are deceived, <note place="margin">How a man may know that he hates ≈øin.</note> it proves only a pa≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In true hatred there are ≈øix things. 1. <hi>An extream dete≈øtation:</hi> Every di≈ølike is not hatred, but true hatred is an extream loathing. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt ca≈øt them away as a men≈øtruous cloath; thou ≈øhalt ≈øay unto it, Get thee hence,</hi> I≈øai. 30. 22. 2. <hi>An earne≈øt ≈øeparation:</hi> He that hated his wife did ≈øue out a Bill of divorce from her in the Law. 3. <hi>An irreconcileable alienation:</hi> Two angry men may be made friends; but if two men hate each other, friend≈øhip is everla≈øtingly broken betwixt them. 4. <hi>A con≈øtant and perpetual colluctation:</hi> If they cannot be ≈øevered one from the other, they ≈øtill oppo≈øe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict one with the other. 5. <hi>A deadly intention</hi> and de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for nothing ≈øatisfies hatred, but death and ruine; <hi>Saul</hi> hated <hi>David,</hi> and ≈øought his life, <hi>Ab≈øalom</hi> hated <hi>Amnon,</hi> and killed him. 6. <hi>An impartial aver≈øation;</hi> hatred is of the whole kind, <hi>I hate every fal≈øe way:</hi> Wilt thou now know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath changed thy heart, then ask thy heart; What is it that thou abhorre≈øt as the ≈øuperlative evil? what is that which thou would≈øt have ≈øeparated as far from thee, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is from hell? what is that thy heart will never renew league or friend≈øhip with any more? what is that again≈øt which thy ≈øoul doth ri≈øe, and with which (as <hi>I≈ørael</hi> with <hi>Amalek,)</hi> thou ha≈øt war for ever? what is that which thou wilt be avenged of, and daily do≈øt endeavour the mortifying and crucifying of? what is that which thou ≈øets thy heart again≈øt, in the comprehen≈øive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thereof, whether great, or little, open, or ≈øecret? If it be ≈øin, if it be thy ≈øins, a≈ø≈øuredly here is true hatred of ≈øin, and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuredly here is a mo≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhing Character of a ≈øound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion and change. It was not wont to be thus with thee, nor
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115664:165"/> is this findeable in any unconverted per≈øon who≈øoever. Sin was once to thee as <hi>Dalilah</hi> to <hi>Sam≈øon,</hi> and now is it to thee as <hi>Tamar</hi> to <hi>Amnon.</hi> It was a ≈øweet mor≈øel once which thou held≈øt fa≈øt, but now it is the men≈øtruous cloath which thou do≈øt ca≈øt away, and ≈øay, get thee hence; what have I to do any more with Idols? If it be thus with thee, ble≈øs thy God who hath ≈øhewed grace to thy ≈øoul.</p>
               <p>2. When the Lord hath changed and converted the heart of a ≈øinner, <hi>the ≈øinner pre≈øently flies unto Je≈øus Christ:</hi> The fir≈øt ≈øtroke of Grace is on the heart, and the fir≈øt breathing of Grace is for Chri≈øt; as the new born babe flies unto the bre≈øts, or as any creature doth to its center, and place of re≈øt. For when the heart is changed by converting grace, 1. It breeds the mo≈øt exqui≈øite di≈øcovery and ≈øen≈øe of ≈øin, and con≈øequently of the ≈øouls need of Chri≈øt. 2. It is mo≈øt impatient of di≈øtance or difference with God, and prizeth his reconciled favour ≈øuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, cannot live without it. 3. It ≈øeeth nothing more valuable in it ≈øelf, or more ≈øutable to its condition then Chri≈øt, <hi>Christus amor meus pondus meum.</hi> And therefore, if you take notice of it, you may experimentally find upon the fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øions of Grace, that the ≈øoul is mo≈øtly taken up with Chri≈øt, and with Faith: Oh, that I might be found in him! Oh, that I could believe on him! It ≈øees excellency in Chri≈øt, and Peace in Chri≈øt, and Redemption in Chri≈øt, and Righteou≈øne≈øs in Chri≈øt, and Grace in Chri≈øt, and Kindne≈øs in Chri≈øt, and Help, and Life, and Heaven, and all in Chri≈øt. In Conver≈øion, Chri≈øt ≈øecretly draws the Soul to him≈øelf; and being converted, the ≈øoul ≈øtrives to draw Chri≈øt to it ≈øelf; It would have Chri≈øt, it mu≈øt have Chri≈øt; it is never well, it is never ≈øatisfied until it hath Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>3. When the Lord hath converted and changed the heart of a ≈øinner, there is wrought in him <hi>a pre≈øent love of God:</hi> It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to ≈øee how the Tide turns upon Conver≈øion. There was once one found weeping very bitterly; and being demanded, why! O, ≈øaid he, all other things are loved, but <hi>Amorum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur,</hi> Love it ≈øelf is not loved. So before Conver≈øion, a man could find love for his Parents, and love for his Relations, and love for his Recreations, and love for his Profits, and love for his Sins; but no love for God. But after Conver≈øion, the man can
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115664:166"/> ≈øcarce find any love for any, unle≈øs it be for his God, and in his God. A graciou≈øly changed Heart is enabled to ≈øee, 1. The glories in God; tho≈øe mo≈øt Pure and Amiable Excellencies in God. 2. The Tran≈øcendent Love of God to it, in the Eternity of it, in the Freene≈øs of it, in the Sweetne≈øs and Goodne≈øs of it. 3. The Un≈øpeakable Communications and Bounties of God towards it in Je≈øus Chri≈øt; for the pre≈øent, and for the future: It is Grace which makes us to ≈øee what a gracious God he is: It is Grace which makes us to ≈øee what a Royal gift Je≈øus Chri≈øt is; It is Grace which makes us apprehen≈øive of all the Love in God, and from God; and therefore no marvel that the changed heart fals pre≈øently in love with God; <hi>(O Love the Lord all ye his Saints)</hi> into a <hi>Love of Friend≈øhip,</hi> and into a <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> as they ≈øpeake; that it admires God, and prizeth Communion with him; and takes its full and highe≈øt delight in him: <hi>Plu≈øquam mea, plu≈øquam meos, plu≈øquam me,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. When the Lord converts and changeth a per≈øon, the man pre≈øently <hi>Steps into the path of new Obedience;</hi> when Grace hath changed the Heart, the Heart in≈øtantly changeth its Ma≈øter and its ≈øervice; O it will not live as it hath done, for a thou≈øand Worlds; It is a ≈øervant of ≈øin no more, but a ≈øervant of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs: look on any converted man (≈øince the Word began,) as ≈øoon as ever Grace dropt into his Heart, a newne≈øs of Obedience dropt into his Life, again≈øt all Ea≈øe, Plea≈øures, Profits, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, Di≈øcouragements, Threats, Dangers; It was ≈øo with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> with all tho≈øe <hi>thou≈øands</hi> in the Acts, with all tho≈øe <hi>Ephe≈øians;</hi> And indeed it cannot be otherwi≈øe, fora≈øm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch as all their external cour≈øe is but the pul≈øe of the Heart. The <hi>Pondus</hi> of the will is changed, it is at the command of the Heart; which being brought into God, the ≈øervices of the heart are al≈øo brought in with it. O, that you would peru≈øe your ≈øelves in this ≈øecond Tryal, what pre≈øent contratiety you find in your Hearts; It is a very neer Tryal, and a mo≈øt Infallible di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the truth or fal≈øhood, or your Change.</p>
               <p>3. The la≈øt Contrariety or Change (which I ≈øhall but touch) <note place="margin">As to the time future.</note> re≈øpects <hi>the time Future:</hi> there are five admirable Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the time future, which may be found in every truly Changed and Converted per≈øon. 1.

But when that trouble is off, all is off again; the Water which was heated, grows cold again; <hi>Saul</hi> is pur≈øuing <hi>David</hi> again, and <hi>Foelix</hi> is covetous again. But if the change be from grace, though trouble be off, yet the heart is again≈øt ≈øin, and is for good; for grace ≈øets us again≈øt ≈øin, as it makes us unholy, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and not only, or principally, as it makes us uncomfortable and mi≈øerable. 2. When the change ari≈øeth only from a troubling con≈øcience, not from a contrariety to God, but to us: <hi>It doth not ari≈øe from a hatred of ≈øin, and a love of good; but only from a hatred of torment, a ≈øelf-love,</hi> and a love of ea≈øe; the man loves that ≈øin, that he dares not now commit, and hates the good which now he doth; he doth the good, only as a means to take off his trouble; he doth it not as a work in which he delights, nor doth he flie ≈øin as an evil which he hates; he flies ≈øin as it is <hi>malum ≈øen≈øibile,</hi> not as it is <hi>malum ≈øpirituale:</hi> But in a gracious change, trouble doth not cau≈øe hatred, but hatred cau≈øeth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ≈øin. 3. When the change is only from a troubling con≈øcience, <hi>then when the trouble is gone, the mans heart is more hardned,</hi> and he growes more wicked then ever before, and in after ≈øinnings, le≈øs ≈øen≈øible, and le≈øs troubled; as Iron growes more hardned after it hath been in the fire, or water that is ≈øtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped more violent. <hi>If they be again intangled, and overcome, the latter end is wor≈øe with them then the beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. But where the heart is changed by grace, the more grace, ≈øtill the more ≈øen≈øe of ≈øin, and ≈øtill the more fear to ≈øin, and ≈øtill the more love of God. 4.

Bread is ≈øweet to an hungry man, out of what≈øoever hand it comes; and is it not more ≈øweet when it comes out of the hand of love and kindne≈øs? O Sirs! even the ordinary mercies to a converted man, have a ≈øweet di≈øtinction in them; they are ≈øo perfumed, they are ≈øo di≈øtilled, they are ≈øo carved, they are all of them the ki≈ø≈øes of a father, the gifts of a gracious God. Every bit of Bread thou eate≈øt, and every draught of Beer thou drinke≈øt, and every piece of Cloath thou weare≈øt, it is the ≈øpecial provi≈øion of thy mo≈øt gracious God, and thy lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father: If ≈øome one royal mercy in the Covenant be able ≈øometimes to ≈øweeten an Ocean, to turn hell into heaven, to wipe off all tears, and put the ≈øoul almo≈øt into an exta≈øie of joy; what rivers of joy then can the whole Covenant afford? If the lifting up of the light of Gods countenance upon the ≈øoul, (which is but one beam of the Covenant) if his ≈øaving to a man, Soul, I am thy Salvation; if one word, <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy ≈øins are forgiven thee,</hi> imprints a ≈øuperlative comfort, a joy un≈øpeakable and full of glory; if one drop be ≈øo ≈øweet, how ≈øweet is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? if one Grape, what is the clu≈øter of Grapes?

The other is, That there is a greater power in the pre≈øence of the chiefe≈øt good to make the Soul joyful, then there can be in the rece≈øs or ab≈øence of the lea≈øt kind of good to make it uncomfortable. Were Afflictions the greate≈øt evils, and were Creatures the be≈øt good, then joy could not con≈øi≈øt with afflictions; but God is the chiefe≈øt good, and the Chri≈øtian enjoyes him under all afflictions as his in≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good; <hi>Ergo.</hi> 2. As Afflictions do not take off the <note place="margin">Times of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are his mo≈øt proper ≈øea≈øons for joy</note> Chri≈øtians true joy, <hi>≈øo the times of afflictions are oft times the mo≈øt proper ≈øea≈øons for joy and comfort to his ≈øoul.</hi> There are three ≈øea≈øons of ≈øpecial comforts which God is plea≈øed to re≈øerve for his ≈øervants, one is <hi>after great temptations,</hi> or to prepare again≈øt them; as that Voice, <hi>This is my well beloved Son,</hi> came to Chri≈øt immediately before his temptation. The ≈øecond is, <hi>after
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115664:178"/> great Humiliations.</hi> God who <hi>comforts them that are ca≈øt down,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 6. The Angel comforted Chri≈øt after his Agony; the Cordial comes after the Phy≈øick. The third is, before and under great afflictions and tryals: <hi>Paul</hi> was to appear before <hi>Nero,</hi> but fir≈øt <hi>God appeared to him ≈øaying, Be of good cheer</hi> Paul. <hi>He is come, he is come,</hi> ≈øaid the Martyr when he ≈øaw the ≈øtake; and <hi>Stephen ≈øaw heaven opened</hi> before he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The comforts of heaven came into his heart ju≈øt before the ≈øtones were thrown at him to da≈øh out his brains. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3. Ble≈ø≈øed be God, even the Father of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Father of mercies and God of all comforts, who comforteth us in all our tribulations; for as our ≈øufferings abound, ≈øo our Con≈øolation aboundeth through Chri≈øt.</hi> Is not the night a ≈øea≈øon to light a Candle? and is not weakne≈øs the ≈øea≈øon to give a Cordial? and is not the winter a ≈øea≈øon to make a Fire? When doth or can the Chri≈øtian more need the comforts of God, then when all comforts on earth do fail him? 3. As afflictions deprive not the Chri≈øtian of the true principles of Joy, <hi>≈øo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Afflictions cannot hinder his principles of Joy from acting in a way of comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>can they hinder tho≈øe principles in him≈øelf from acting in a way of comfort.</hi> There are two principles (e≈øpecially) in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian which enable him to joy and comfort: One is <hi>Faith:</hi> It is ≈øtill Day, and never Night with Faith; the Star ≈øhines be≈øt in the night; <hi>(Believing ye rejoyced with joy un≈øpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8.) Now Faith can act very comfortably in uncomfortable times; it can ≈øee the ≈øame God, with the ≈øame Love, and in the ≈øame Covenant, and in the ≈øame Relation, in Adver≈øity as in Pro≈øperity: <hi>Hab. 3. 17. Although the Fig-tree ≈øhall not blo≈ø≈øome, &amp;c. yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5. 3. <hi>And not only ≈øo, but we glory in tribulation, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Sam. 29. 6 the people ≈øpake of ≈øtoning him, <hi>but David encouraged him≈øelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Rom. 8. 35. <hi>Who ≈øhall ≈øeparate us from the love of Chri≈øt? &amp;c.</hi> If even in afflictions I can go unto the ≈øame armes of Chri≈øt, and unto the ≈øame bre≈øts of divine Love, and into the ≈øame chamber of Pre≈øence; if I can look upon God as my God, and ≈øee him to be my Father, that I can make known my heart to him, and he can make known his favour to me, what ≈øhould hinder me now to be joyful, who ≈øtill do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him who (alone) makes all my joy? Another is, the

Rightly understand what it is ≈øtrictly to walk with God:</hi> It is an endeavour in your affections and duties to draw near to God in all well-plea≈øing, and to an≈øwer the will of God. The Chri≈øtians cour≈øe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is his daily communion with his God in this life: When thou praye≈øt, what is Praying, but a divine conference of the ≈øoul with God? and when thou heare≈øt, what is this but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conference of God with the ≈øoul? and when thou repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt, what is that but a recovery and return of the ≈øoul to God? and when thou believe≈øt, what is that but the recumbency of the ≈øoul on the goodne≈øs of God? and when thou receive≈øt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what is it, but a communion, a fea≈øting with Je≈øus Chri≈øt? If a ≈øtrict walking be nothing but a divine and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, why doe≈øt thou, how dare≈øt thou to judge of it as the onely Bar to ≈øhut out all joy and comfort? Was there ever any affectionate Wife, that thought it an injury to her Joy to ≈øpeak with her Husband, or to enjoy the ≈øociety of her Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? Was there ever any faithfull Friend, who thought it a mi≈øery, a burthen to enjoy the ≈øociety of his Friends, to open his heart unto his Friend? How then can it be a prejudice to any mans joy, to enjoy communion with his God? 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult with experience,</hi> which hath travelled in the ≈øtrict ways of God; either thine own experience, (if any,) which day of thy life hath been clo≈øed up with heartie≈øt joy? whether the day of licentiou≈øne≈øs, or the day of ≈øtrictne≈øs? That day which thou ha≈øt let out to thy lu≈øts, hath made the night a trembling to thee; that day which thou ha≈øt redeemed for walking with God, hath always given unto thee the ≈øweete≈øt re≈øt and repo≈øe at night: The experience of godly people; have any of them ever found more ≈øoul rejoycing then when they have abounded in ≈øtricte≈øt obedience? This is thy burthen, but it is their delight; the pure≈øt walking hath di≈øtilled the ≈øweete≈øt joy, and their loo≈øer walking hath been the cau≈øe of their greate≈øt ≈øorrows. It is with a ≈øtrict Chri≈øtian as with the Sun, which ≈øtill keeps to the Ecliptique Line, and is of all the Stars the mo≈øt glorious and comfortable when it is at the highe≈øt; and the higher Sun, the purer and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er light: And it is with the loo≈øe Chri≈øtian as with the uneven foot, the wry ≈øtepping is the cau≈øe of unjoynting, or pinching and

There is a ≈øtrict way for men to walk in, but it is the way to life, to eternal life: Now even that alone is ≈øufficient to create joy, that the≈øe ≈øteps after a while will bring me to appear before the God of Gods in Sion; and truly, there is no end what≈øoever, the which if it be (in it ≈øelf) amiable and comfortable, but it darts al≈øo an amiablene≈øs and comfortablene≈øs upon all the ≈øteps and paths which tend unto it.</p>

It ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely condemns and abridgeth the ≈øoul of man of all ≈øinfull joys, of joys and delights which ari≈øe from his ≈øinfull lu≈øts and ways; and is it not the great goodne≈øs of God, to deny us leave to drink cups of poi≈øon, and gla≈ø≈øes of hell? Or is it po≈ø≈øible that any Chri≈øtian ≈øhould to thee, that ≈øin ≈øhould be thy delight, which is a departing of the poor ≈øoul from God, which is an incen≈øing of the wrath of God, which was ≈øuch a dreadfull burthen to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, which puts the ≈øoul under the wrath and cur≈øe of God; one act whereof mu≈øt co≈øt more then all the world is worth to pardon it. 2. It doth onely order our outward lawfull joys and delights, for the ≈øea≈øons, for the mea≈øures, for other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances; ≈øo that they may be our ≈øauce, not our food; our helps to Godline≈øs, not damps thereto: It is but the Bridle on the Hor≈øe, the Pale for the Garden, the Finger on the Dial.

               <p>To this I an≈øwer, 1. It is certain, that true grace 1. doth make <hi>the clearest di≈øcovery of ≈øin: 2. It yields the tenderest ≈øen≈øe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115664:180"/> of ≈øin,</hi> (for it takes away the heart of ≈øtone, and gives an heart of fle≈øh,) and nothing makes the heart more mournfull, then true grace.</p>

That terrour for ≈øin and joy of heart are incon≈øi≈øtent; Legal terrour and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical joy are ≈øo, but Evangelical ≈øorrow and Evangelical joy are not ≈øo; for as one grace is con≈øi≈øtent with another grace, ≈øo one heavenly affection is con≈øi≈øtent with another heavenly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And there are three things which (to me) fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, That Evangelical mourning is con≈øi≈øtent with Spiritual joy: One is, That ≈øuch a mourning is but a drop out of the eye of faith; <hi>They ≈øhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. and certainly, nothing comes from faith, but what is comfortable; all is Go≈øpel that Faith trades in. Another is, That the mourning heart is a renewed heart, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the gracious heart is a joyous heart. The third is, That the mourning ≈øinner is a pardoned ≈øinner: <hi>(Cum intueor flentem, ≈øentis igno≈øcibilem,)</hi> if the fountain of ≈øorrow be ≈øet open in the heart, the fountain of mercy is ≈øet open in heaven, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. compared with chap. 13. 1. Yea let me add to this al≈øo three experiences: 1. One is this, <hi>That the Christian is never more ≈øad and mournfull, then when he feels his heart least mournfull:</hi> He is then ca≈øt down; O (≈øaith he) into what a condition am I brought? I was wont to find a tender, ≈øen≈øible mourning ≈øpirit; but me thinks now my heart is grown hard again: O Lord, why am I now hardened from thy fear? And the man never gives over with God and him≈øelf, until tenderne≈øs be renewed in his heart again. 2. <hi>That the Christian is never more joyfull, then when he is most mournfull: Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed are they that ≈øow be≈øides all Waters,</hi> ≈øaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that mourn, for they ≈øhall be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt. <hi>They that ≈øow in tears ≈øhall reap in joy,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David.</hi> Godly ≈øorrow is the Water that is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Wine; One drop of a guilty Con≈øcience is able to turn all our Joyes into Bitterne≈øs, and one drop of
